test-environment-aeghhgwpe-pro01a,it is immoral to kill animals as evolved human beings it is our moral duty to inflict as little pain as possible for our survival so if we do not need to inflict pain to animals in order to survive we should not do it farm animals such as chickens pigs sheep and cows are sentient living beings like us they are our evolutionary cousins and like us they can feel pleasure and pain the 18th century utilitarian philosopher jeremy bentham even believed that animal suffering was just as serious as human suffering and likened the idea of human superiority to racism it is wrong to farm and kill these animals for food when we do not need to do so the methods of farming and slaughter of these animals are often barbaric and cruel even on supposedly free range farms 1 ten billion animals were slaughtered for human consumption each year stated peta and unlike the farms long time ago where animals roamed freely today most animals are factory farmed crammed into cages where they can barely move and fed a diet adulterated with pesticides and antibiotics these animals spend their entire lives in their prisoner cells so small that they can t even turn around many suffer serious health problems and even death because they are selectively bred to grow or produce milk or eggs at a far greater rate than their bodies are capable of coping with at the slaughterhouse there were millions of others who are killed every year for food further on tom regan explains that all duties regarding animals are indirect duties to one another from a philosophical point of view he illustrates it with an analogy regarding children children for example are unable to sign contracts and lack rights but they are protected by the moral contract nonetheless because of the sentimental interests of others so we have then duties involving these children duties regarding them but no duties to them our duties in their case are indirect duties to other human beings usually their parents 2 with this he supports the theory that animals must be protected from suffering as it is moral to protect any living being from suffering not because we have a moral contract with them but mainly due to respect of life and recognition of suffering itself 1 claire suddath a brief history of veganism time 30 october 2008 2 tom regan the case for animal rights 1989

test-environment-ehwsnwu-pro02a,underground nuclear storage is safe underground nuclear waste storage means that nuclear waste is stored at least 300m underground i1 the harm of a leak 300m underground is significantly limited if the area has been chosen correctly then there should be no water sources nearby to contaminate if this is the case then a leak s harm would be limited to the layers of sediment nearby which would be unaffected by radiation by comparison a leak outside might lead to animals nearby suffering from contamination further nuclear waste might reach water sources should there be a leak above ground if it is raining heavily when the leak happens for example further the other options available such as above ground storage present a potentially greater danger should something go wrong this is because it is much easier for nuclear waste to leak radiation into the air this is problematic because even a hint of radiation may well cause people to panic owing to the damaging and heavily publicised consequences of previous nuclear safety crises as such underground storage is safer both directly and indirectly 1 as well as this underground storage also prevents nuclear waste or nuclear radiation from reaching other states and as such results in greater safety across borders 2 further storing all nuclear waste underground means that countries can concentrate their research and training efforts on responding to subterranean containment failures focus and specialisation of this type is much more likely to avert a serious release of nuclear material from an underground facility than the broad and general approach that will be fostered by diverse and distinct above ground storage solutions 1 europe eyes underground nuclear waste repositories infowars ireland 20 02 2010 2 eu debates permanent storage for nuclear waste 04 11 2010 aboutmyplanet i1 i am not sure how to replace this section leakage of radioactive material into the air is a minimal danger the contributor may be referring to the ejection of irradiated dust and other particulates that has occurred when nuclear power stations have suffered explosive containment failures but this is not comparable to the types of containment failures that might happen in facilities used to store spent nuclear fuel rods and medical waste one of the more substantial risks presented by underground storage is release of nuclear material into a water source
test-environment-ehwsnwu-pro01a,underground nuclear storage is necessary even states without nuclear waste programs tend to generate radioactive waste for example research and medicine both use nuclear material and nuclear technology technologies such as medical imaging equipment are dependent and the use of radioactive elements this means that all states produce levels of nuclear waste that need to be dealt with moreover many non nuclear states are accelerating their programmes of research and investment into nuclear technologies with the exception of germany there is an increasing consensus among developed nations that nuclear power is the only viable method of meeting rising domestic demand for energy in the absence of reliable and efficient renewable forms of power generation the alternatives to putting nuclear waste in underground storage tend to be based around the reuse of nuclear waste in nuclear power stations whilst this is viable in some areas in countries which lack the technology to be able to do this and in countries which don t need to rely on nuclear power this option becomes irrelevant further even this process results in the creation of some nuclear waste so in countries with the technology to implement such a solution the disposal of the remaining nuclear waste is still an issue as such underground nuclear storage is a necessary method that should be used to dispose of nuclear waste 1 1 the eu s deep underground storage plan 03 11 2010 world nuclear news

test-health-hdond-pro01a,a practical solution there are many mechanisms by which this policy could be implemented the one common thread is that those hoping to receive organs would be divided into those registered as donors and those who are non donors potential recipients who are non donors would only receive an organ if all requests by donors for such an organ are filled for example if there is a scarcity of donated kidneys with the b serotype organ donors requiring a b kidney would all receive kidneys before any non donors receive them the existing metrics for deciding priority among recipients can still be applied within these lists among both donors and non donors individuals could be ranked on who receives an organ first based on who has been on the waiting list longer or who has more priority based on life expectancy this policy simply adds the caveat that non donors only access organs once all donors for their particular organ are satisfied what defines a donor could vary it could be that they must have been a donor for a certain number of years or that they must have been a donor prior to needing a transplant or even a pledge to become a donor henceforth and indeed even if they are terminally ill and for other reasons do not recover some of their organs may still be usable finally this policy need not preclude private donations or swaps of organs and instead can simply be applied to the public system

test-health-hgwhwbjfs-con01a,schools should educate about healthy choices not make them on the students behalf although it might be very tempting for the government to try and attack the problem of childhood obesity by attempting to change in essence the very choices our kids can make this is the wrong way of going about doing it the purpose of schools is education the genesis of active and useful members of society a large extent of what schools do is imprinting the ideas the society values in most western countries those would be the ideas of fairness democracy freedom of expression etc the other side of the coin is the transference of knowledge knowledge of mathematics history but also of biology health and nutrition we see thus that the proposed ban on specific choices one makes in school whether be it choices regarding food or choices regarding the clothes one wears the ideas one expresses and so on is truly meaningless in the existing concept of education what the schools should be doing is putting more emphasis on getting the message of the importance of a healthy lifestyle across our kids should be taught that this lifestyle consists of more than just whether or not we chose to eat a hamburger and fries for lunch in short this ban falls short of truly educating the children about how important physical activity balanced meals and indulging in moderation are they should also focus on the importance of choice since in the case of childhood obesity making the right nutritional and lifestyle choices is of paramount importance but they should also focus on the importance of choice for a society and how all should take responsibility for their choices in such a society

test-health-dhghwapgd-pro01a,the current patent system is unjust and creates perverse incentives that benefit large pharmaceutical companies at the expense of ordinary citizens the current drug patent regime is largely designed to benefit and shield the profits of large pharmaceutical companies this is due to the fact that most of the laws on drug patents were written by lobbyists and voted upon by politicians in the pay of those firms the pharmaceutical industry is simply massive and has one of the most powerful lobbies in most democratic states particularly the united states the laws are orchestrated to contain special loopholes which these firms can exploit in order to maximize profits at the expense of the taxpayer and of justice for example through a process called evergreening drug firms essentially re patent drugs when they near expiration by patenting certain compounds or variations of the drug1 this can extend the life of some patents indefinitely ensuring firms can milk customers at monopoly prices long after any possible costs of research or discovery are recouped a harm that arises from this is the enervating effect that patents can generate in firms when the incentive is to simply rest on one s patents waiting for them to expire before doing anything else societal progress is slowed in the absence of such patents firms are necessarily forced to keep innovating to stay ahead to keep looking for profitable products and ideas the free flow of ideas generated by the abolition of drug patents will invigorate economic dynamism 1 faunce thomas 2004 the awful truth about evergreening the age available
test-health-dhghwapgd-pro03a,production of generic drugs reduce medical costs by allowing increased production and the development of superior production methods increasing market efficiency the sale of generic drugs invariably reduces costs to consumers this is due to two reasons it may be the case that an individual or firm with a patent essentially a monopoly right to the production of something may not have the ability to efficiently go about meeting demand for it patents slow or even stop the dissemination of the production methods especially when a patent holder is unwilling to license production to others1 such an outcome is deleterious to society as with no restrictions on drug production an efficient producer or producers will emerge to meet the needs of the public producing an amount of drugs commensurate with demand and thus equilibrating market price with that demand2 this market equilibration is impossible under conventional patent laws as it is in the interest of firms to withhold production and to engage in monopolist rent seeking from consumers3 this leads firms to deliberately under produce which they have been shown to do in many cases as for example the case of miacalcic a drug used to treat paget s disease in which its producer deliberately kept production down in order to keep prices high4 when a firm is given monopoly power over a drug it has the ability to abuse it and history shows that is what they are wont to do by allowing the production of generic drugs this monopoly power is broken and people can get the drugs they need at costs that are not marked far above their free market value 1 kinsella stephan 2010 patents kill compulsory licenses and genzyme s life saving drug mises institute available 2stim rishand 2006 profit from your idea how to make smart licensing decisions berkeley nolo 3 lee timothy 2007 patent rent seeking cato at liberty available 4 flanders today 2010 big pharma denies strategic shortages flanders today

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro02a,hate speech the enforcement of the laws proposed in this article will be fraught complex and difficult however the difficulty of administering a law is never a good argument for refusing to enforce it the censorship of the written word ended in england with the lady chatterley and oz obscenity trials but this liberalisation of publication standards has not prevented the state from prosecuting hate speech when it appears in print it is clear that although we have more latitude than ever to say or write what we want no matter how objectionable standards and taboos continue to exist we can take it that these taboos are especially important and valuable to the running of a stable society as they have persisted despite the legal and cultural changes that have taken place over the last fifty years hate speech is prosecuted and censored because of its power to intrude into the lives of individuals who have not consented to receive it as pointed out in jeremy waldron s response 1 to timothy garton ash s piece 2 on hate speech hateful comments are not dangerous because they insight gullible individuals to abandon their inhibitions and engage in race riots hate speech is harmful because it recreates cheaply and in front of a very large audience an atmosphere in which vulnerable minorities are put in fear of becoming the targets of violence and prejudice additionally hate speech harms by defaming groups by propagating lies and half truths about practices and beliefs with the objective of socially isolating those groups gangsta rap does all of these things yet legal responses to the publication of songs containing such lyrics as rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome have been timid at best even if we maintain our liberal approach to taboo breaking forms of expression we can still link hip hop to many of the harms that hate speech produces gangsta rap gives the impression that african american and latin american neighbourhoods throughout the usa are violent lawless places even if the pronouncements of rappers such as 50 cent and nwa are overblown or fictitious they enforce social division by vividly discouraging people from entering or interacting with poor minority communities they damage those communities directly by creating a fear of criminality that serves to limit trust and cohesion among individual community members finally violent hip hop is also defamatory it propagates an image of minority communities that emphasises violence poverty and nihilism whilst loudly proclaiming its authenticity it is completely irrelevant that these images of minority communities are produced by members of those communities it is on this basis however protracted the process of classification must become that the content of hip hop songs should be assessed and censored liberal democracies are prepared to go to great lengths to adjudicate on speech that could potentially promote racial or religious hatred the same standards should be applied to hip hop music because it is capable of producing identical harms 1 waldron j the harm of hate speech freespeechdebate 20 march 2012 2 garton ash t living with difference freespeechdebate 22 january 2012
test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro01a,classification not censorship we should expect fans of an art form that is subjected to public criticism and vilification to leap to its defence some of these aficionados whether the medium in question is cinema fine art or pop music make the case for the value of their favourite mode of expression by overstating its positive effects hip hop has long been the focus of controversies surrounding violent music hip hop is closely associated with low level criminality as noted above a number of highly successful hip hop artists have been attacked or killed as a result of feuds within the industry and links between managers promoters and criminal gangs as the academic john mcwhorter has pointed out in numerous 1 publications 2 the positive political and social impact of rap music has been massively overstated as a result of highly charged media coverage of hip hop linked violence as a result attempts to address some of the hips hops most objectionable content lyrics that are misogynist and blankly and uncritically violent have been condemned as unjust assaults on the right to free expression attacks on negative content in hip hop have been made all the more emotive because they appear to be an attempt to restrict the speech of members of vulnerable and marginalised communities side proposition agrees with mcwhorter that listening to music that contains violent themes will not in the absence of other factors cause individuals to behave in a violent way however the content of rap and its strong links with the youngest inhabitants of marginalised stigmatised urban areas mean that it damages the developmental opportunities of teenagers and young people and harms others perceptions of the communities they live in hip hop trades on its authenticity the extent to which it faithfully portrays the lived experience of the inhabitants of deprived inner city areas the greater the veracity of a hip hop track the greater its popularity and cache among fans musicians have gained public recognition as a result of being directly involved in street crime and gang activities 50 cent a high profile gansta artist owes his popularity in part to a shooting in 2000 that left him with 9 bullet wounds 3 this supposed link to reality is the most dangerous aspect of contemporary hip hop culture unlike the simplistic make believe of say action films the experiences related by rappers are also their public personas and become the rationale for their success rap through materialist boasting and sexualised music videos tells vulnerable young men and women from isolated neighbourhoods that their problems can be solved by adopting similarly nihilistic personas the poverty that affects many of the communities that hip hop artists identify with does more than separate individuals from economic opportunity it also confines the inhabitants of these communities geographically politically and culturally it prevents young men and women from becoming aware of perspectives on the world and society that run contrary to the violence of main stream rap with television dominated by the gangsta motif marginalised youngsters are left with little in the way of dissenting voices to convince them that hip hop takes a subjective and commercialised approach to the lives and communities that rappers claim to represent in effect controversial hip hop is capable of sponsoring violent behaviour when it is marketed as an accurate portrayal of relationships values and principles under these circumstances adolescents whose own identity is nascent and malleable can easily be misled into emulating the exploits and attitudes of rappers 4 side proposition advocates the control and classification of controversial forms of music including but not limited to hip hop consistent with principles 1 and 10 classification of this type will follow similar schemes applied to movies and videogames assessments of the content of music will be conducted by a politically independent organisation musicians and record companies will have the ability to appeal the decisions of this body crucially the ban on music containing violent lyrics will take the form of a categorisation scheme content will not be blocked from sale or censored instead as with the sale of pornographic material in many liberal democratic states music found to contain especially violent lyrics will be confined to closed off areas in shops to which only adults as defined in law will be admitted its performance on television radio and in cinemas will be banned live performances of restricted music will be obliged to enforce strict age monitoring policies online distributors of music will be compelled to comply with similar age restrictions and intentionally exposing minors to violent music will be punishable under child protection laws this approach has the advantage of limiting access to violent content only to consumers who are judged in general to be mature enough to understand that its message and the posturing of singers does not equate to permission to engage in deviant behaviour 1 mcwhorter j how hip

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro03a,defending hip hop artists right to free speech the intervention of the state is necessary in order to ensure that aggressive forms of hip hop remain accessible only to adults especially in neighbourhoods and home environments that are not part of a cohesive caring community some degree of public control over the content of hip hop will also help to preserve the diversity accessibility of the genre in the face of commercial dominance by violent forms of rap mainstream success in hip hop has become synonymous with gangsta rap and with artists who have backgrounds that lend veracity to their lurid verses however many of these supposedly authentic experiences consist of little more than exaggeration and invented personas when being interviewed about the controversial content of her son s single fuck tha police the mother of rapper ice cube commented that i don t see him saying those curse words i see him like an actor the existence of pornography attests to the market for forms of media that fulfil base and simplistic human fantasies much the same can be said for the violent and cynical content of rap singles unlike the relationship between cinema and pornography however many commentators appear to regard gangsta rap as being synonymous with hip hop a position as deceptive as a film critic claiming that all movies are inevitably tied to pornography the significant public profile and poor regulation of hip hop have meant that gangsta rap fans have become the genre s dominant class of consumer the amount of money that fans are willing to spend on singles albums concert tickets and associated branded goods means that labels that cultivate relationships with gangsta rappers have become the gatekeepers of the hip hop genre in general conscious rappers who do not glorify violence along with musicians working in other hip hop genres must work with labels that promote acts containing violent lyrics in order to publish their own music either consciously or by design the terrain of contemporary hip hop is hostile to musicians who are not prepared to discuss guns bitches and bling in their work this constitutes a significant barrier to rappers ability to communicate novel messages and listeners ability to receive them it could be called a market failure the pervasive public presence of gangsta rap has effectively denied an audience to other rappers classification has the potential to maximise the freedom and effectiveness of musical expression by hip hop artists who choose not to trade in brutality and misogyny the alternative is to allow hip hop to continue to be dominated by businesses such as death row records low life records and machete music this will lead to hip hop as a medium becoming inextricably linked with violent lyrics and the dubious businesses practices of gangsta labels bosses popular disengagement is much more likely under these circumstances and will actively deny a voice and opportunities to musicians with a different perspective on hip hop
test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con02a,a ban will be ineffective a new legal prohibition on any type of behaviour or conduct can only be set up by investing large amounts of political capital in order to transform vague proposals into a legislative document and then into a fully fledged law this expense can only be justified if the ban is effective if it is seen as a legitimate use of a state s power is enforceable and if it brings about some form of beneficial social change the change being sought in this instance is a reduction in the violence criminality and social disaffection that some people associate with hip hop music and its fans laws do not create changes in behaviour simply because they are laws it is unlikely that the consumers of hip hop will refrain from listening to it the ease with which music can be distributed and performed means that any ban on violent songs will inevitably be ineffective file sharing networks and cross border online stores such as ebay and silk road already enable people to obtain media and controlled goods with little more than a credit card and a forwarding address the total value of all of the music illegally pirated during 2007 is estimated to be 12 5 billion the same network of file sharing systems and data repositories would be used to distribute banned music if proposition s policies became law current urban music genres are already defined and supported by grassroots musicians who specialise in assembling tracks using minimal resources before sharing them among friends or broadcasting them on short range pirate radio stations just as the internet contains a resilient ready made distribution network for music urban communities contain large numbers of ambitious talented amateur artists who will step into fill the void created by large record company s withdrawal from controversial or prohibited genres although a formal ban on the distribution of music has yet to happen within a western liberal democracy similar laws have been created to restrict access to violent videogames following widespread reports of the damaging effects that exposure to violent videogames might have on children australia banned outright the publication of a succession of violent and action oriented titles however in several instances implementation of this ban led only to increased piracy of prohibited games through file sharing networks and attempts by publishing companies to circumvent the ban using websites based in jurisdictions outside australia similar behaviour is likely to result in other liberal democracies following any ban on music with violent lyrics if banned controversial music will move from the managed regulated space occupied by record companies and distributors where business entities and artists agents can engage in structured transparent debate with classification bodies to the partly hidden and unregulated space of the internet as a consequence it will be much more difficult to detect genuinely dangerous material and much harder for artists who do not trade in violent clich s to win fans and recognition as discussed in principle 10 effective control and classification of controversial material can only be achieved if it is discussed with a high specificity and a nuanced understanding of the shared standards that it might offend this would not be possible under a policy that effectively surrenders control of the content of music to the internet
test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con03a,a ban will further marginalise young members of impoverished communities hip hop is an extremely diverse musical genre surprisingly this diversity has evolved from highly minimal series of musical principles at its most basic raping consists of nothing more than rhyming verses that are delivered to a beat this simplicity reflects the economically marginalised communities that hip hop emerged from all that anyone requires in order to learn how to rap or to participate in hip hop culture is a pen some paper and possibly a disc of breaks the looped drum and bass lines that are used to time rap verses thanks to its highly social aspect hip hop continues to function as an accessible form of creative expression for members of some of impoverished communities in both the west and elsewhere in the world point 7 suggests that free speech flourishes when we respect believers but are not forced to respect their beliefs free speech debate discusses this principle in the light of religious belief and religious expression however it is also relevant when we consider how our appraisal of an individual s background culture and values affects our willingness to accept or dismiss what she says the positive case for banning or at least condemning hip hop often rests on its ability to reinforce the negative stereotypes of impoverished and marginalised communities that are propagated by majority communities critics of hip hop note that black men have often been stigmatised as violent uncivilised and predatory they claim that many hip hop artists cultivate a purposefully brutal and misogynist persona the popularity of hip hop reflects the acceptance of this stereotype and further entrenches discrimination against young black men this line of thinking portrays hip hop artists as betrayers or exploiters of their communities reinforcing damaging stereotypes and convincing adolescents that a violent rejection of mainstream society is a way to achieve material success arguments of this type fail to recognise the depth of nuance and meaning that words and word play can convey they are predicated on an assumption that the consumers of hip hop engage with it in a simplistic and uncritical way in short such arguments see hip hop fans as being simple minded and easily influenced this perspective neglects the recognition respect the recognition of equality and inherent dignity that is owed to all contributors of a debate moreover it also bars us from properly assessing the appraisal respect owed to the content of hip hop and other controversial musical genres when hip hop is seen as being inherently harmful and as being targeted at an especially impressionable and vulnerable part of society we both demean members of that group and prevent robust discussion of rap lyrics themselves academics such as john mcwhorter see only the advocacy of violence and nihilism in lyrics such as you grow in the ghetto living second rate and your eyes will sing a song of deep hate but these are words that can also be interpreted as astute observation on the brutality that is bred by social exclusion in point of fact there is little in the previous verse or those that follow it you ll admire all the numberbook takers thugs pimps and pushers and the big money makers that could be interpreted as permitting popularising or endorsing violence that is unless the individual reading the verse had already concluded that its intended audience lacked his own critical perspective and understanding of social norms and values even if an observer were ultimately conclude that a particular hip hop track had no redeeming value a broad interpretation of point 7 suggests that he should at the very least credit its artists and listeners with a modicum of intelligence and reflectiveness when we approach music with a custodial mind set determined to protect young listeners from what we see as harm or exploitation we prevent those individuals from access a form of speech that may be the only affordable method of expression open to them just as we allow individuals the right to be heard in a language of their choosing see point 1 we should also accept that perspectives from marginalised communities may not appear in a conventional form under these circumstances it would be dangerous for us to curtail and marginalise a form of speech geared toward discussing the problems faced by impoverished young people that has against the odds penetrated the mainstream we are likely to deepen existing prejudices by viewing rappers and their fans as infantile impressionable and in need of protection
test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con01a,violent imagery can serve different purposes calls for a ban on music that references or glorifies violence are frequently based on an overly simplistic understanding of contemporary and popular musical genres it is instructive that the loudest voices of protest raised against violent content in hip hop and rock music are overwhelmingly white middle class middle aged newspaper columnists any ban created under these circumstances would reduce the diversity and depth of popular musical genres by preventing musicians from commenting in any way on violent events banning particular musical tracks due only to the fact that they discuss violent acts would be damaging to the creative industries and would not reflect methods currently used to classify and restrict content appearing in other media criminal acts are punished when an act results in a damaging outcome and because that act is performed with a particular dishonest or malicious intention generally someone cannot be found guilty of murder if they did not intend to kill their victim similarly it is unusual for films or videogames to be censored or banned because they happen to depict violent acts the intention that underlies the use of graphic images or words must also be examined as bbc director general mark thompson noted when discussing the controversial religious content of jerry springer the opera with freespeechdebate com jerry springer i saw without feeling that it was offensive to me because the intention of the piece was so clearly a satire about an american talk show host and his world rather than the religious figures as such classification boards will look at the context in which an offensive act is shown the violence of war is portrayed vividly in saving private ryan but the film has not been banned on this basis private ryan portrays violence and suffering in order to remind us of the inhumanity that pervaded the second world war it uses violence to make a didactic point to move its audience to sympathy and disgust if a film were to use images of extreme violence or suffering as a form of entertainment inviting the audience to take pleasure in brutality a classification board would try to restrict or censor its content comparably violent music can use brutal language and themes to make moving and engaging observations about the world violent music does not automatically glorify violence nor does it cause its audience to see violence as something that is glamorous listened to out of context without any attempt to critically analyse the imagery of the song and the intentions of the artists it is easy to condemn many acclaimed examples of popular music as containing violent lyrics by giving into the populist pressure that is represented and generated by newspaper columnists and talk show hosts we risk creating a chilling effect not only on mainstream hip hop culture but on any other musical form that dares to discuss themes that fall outside narrowly and arbitrarily defined limits of social acceptability

test-free-speech-debate-fchbjaj-pro03a,there is a difference between actual journalists and those who like having their names published in newspapers assange has far more claim to the description than many of them one of the things that the leveson inquiry 1 has made all too apparent is that simply working for a newspaper or broadcaster is not a satisfactory definition of journalist in terms of maintaining a professional ethic the difference between those who hacked into phones including that of murdered schoolgirl millie dowler and the journalists who broke the story nick davies and amelia hill 2 could not be starker equally many popular blogs that focus exclusively on opinion or areas of news far more specialist than has traditionally been considered the role of the daily media a more useful definition it would seem relates more to the ethics and aims of the individual or organisation involved this has the advantage of ruling out those organisations devoted to advertising such as listings magazines or shopping channels or those focused purely on entertainment a journalist should therefore have a commitment to revealing and disseminating information that is held by those with power to those over whom they wield that power this means that the journalist gains access to information through various sources and then publicises that information as a story anonymous sources such as those used by assange are a key part of journalism with many of the biggest stories such as watergate only being published because of anonymity 3 by such a definition assange would clearly qualify 4 this was clearly felt to be the case by the new york times the guardian le monde and others who reprinted his original material and drew conclusions from it it would come as something of a surprise to such publications to discover they were not staffed by journalists 1 for a link to the inquiry s website click here 2 the guardian missing milly dowler s voicemail was hack by news of the world nick davies and amelia hill 5 july 2011 3 myers steve study use of anonymous sources peaked in 1970s dropped by 2008 poynter org 9 august 2011 4 the spectator yes julian assange is a journalist alex massie 2 november 2010

test-free-speech-debate-fchbjaj-con03a,wikileaks is not a news organisation it exists exclusively to disseminate classified information no genuine news organisation has such an agenda news organisations provide a variety of functions from reporting the weather to breaking news even the most hardened investigative outlet does not dedicate itself exclusively to revealing classified information it appears to have no interest in what that information is or whether its disclosure causes more harm than good the sole interest is that it is classified that isn t journalism at best it s prurience and at worst egocentricity i know something you don t know the fallout for people s jobs liberty and safety appears not to interest those involved their own about us section makes a point of stating that we accept but do not solicit anonymous sources of information 1 interestingly the whole of the rest of the page talks about maintaining anonymity for both readers and sources and little else it provides screeds of text about themselves a free press and the importance of releasing classified information unusually for a media organisation there are no details about how to complain if a reader feels they or someone else has been misrepresented this means that wikileaks is denying someone s freedom of speech by not giving them a right to reply and have corrections published in an age where even the most stentorian paper of record enshrines such rights one might assume that such devout proclaimers of free speech would shout it from their mast head instead their chat page is mostly full of dire warnings that security forces are watching the reader s every keystroke hardly encouraging for the little guy wishing to clear their name 1 the link to the page is here

test-economy-thsptr-pro05a,a well implemented progressive taxation scheme serve to promote economic growth progressive taxation can serve very effectively to increase the economic welfare and development of societies it does so in three ways first it lifts the poor out of poverty by redistributing the tax burden from them onto the wealthy who are more able to pay and gives them more disposable income to put back into the economy which increases the velocity of money in the system increasing growth 1 second workers will be more likely to work harder since they will feel the system is more equitable perceptions of fairness are very important to individuals people will still work and save since they will want the goods and services they always did in the presence of progressive taxation and will thus not be less motivated as detractors of progressive systems suggest third progressive taxes serve as an automatic stabilizer in the event of recessions and temporary downturns in the market in the sense that a loss of wages due to unemployment or wage cuts places an individual in a lower tax bracket dampening the blow of the initial income loss the american economy is a perfect example of how progressive taxation promotes broader economic growth data shows that average yearly growth has been lessened since the 1950s after the reduction in progressively in the tax system in the 1950s annual growth was 4 1 while in the 1980s when progressively in taxes fell dramatically growth was only 3 2 clearly a progressive tax regime is best for workers and the economy generally 1 boxx t william and gary quinlivan the cultural context of economics and politics lanham university press of america 1994 2 batra ravi the great american deception what politicians won t tell you about our economy and your future new york john wiley and sons 1996
test-economy-thsptr-pro03a,the state should promote the efficient distribution of income in order to maximize the utility derived by society from its economic resources all goods suffer from diminishing marginal utility and this includes money the more money someone the less happy they are made from each successive addition of wealth after a certain point one might be able to buy a second car or a second house with extra money but eventually one runs out of things one particularly wants to buy or own 1 when wealth is unevenly distributed in society the wealth of society is inefficiently distributed the aim of the state must be to attempt to maximize the aggregate utility of its citizens insofar as it is able without damaging the economy with progressive taxation wealth is effectively reallocated to poorer people who gain more utility than the wealthy lose in the process the state has a right to do this not only because it generates a more efficient distribution of income than the market does but also because income is partly a collective good 2 ownership rights to property and the ability to expand them is only possible within the framework of the state thus the state can make a moral ownership claim to some of the products of the services it provides and does so most effectively through the mechanism of progressive taxation 1 thune kent the diminishing marginal utility of wealth the financial philosopher 2008 available 2 weisbrod burton public interest law an economic and institutional analysis berkeley university of california press 1978
test-economy-thsptr-pro04a,progressive taxation promotes a more equal more harmonious society progressive taxation provides real equality of opportunity and serves to level the playing field so that social classes are not fixed everyone deserves a chance to climb the economic ladder but without a regime of progressive taxation this is nearly impossible 1 if tax revenues are generated by flat or regressive taxes the poor will necessarily have to contribute substantial portions of their own income to the state cutting into their ability to consume and save social services must still be financed and the best way to do that is through a progressive tax regime that makes those most able to pay more pay more if more of the burden is placed on the poor and disadvantaged as it must in a flat rate system fewer people will be able to climb out from the social strata in which they are born 2 the more equal society created by these taxes is thus more equitable since it affords people greater opportunities it is also more harmonious since well funded services keep people from feeling desperate and to turn to such things as crime but greater equality itself can also be beneficial as it reduces distinctions between groups in society and prevents stratification into social classes based on wealth people who are more alike can sympathize and empathize more with one another progressive taxation thus promotes a very real and powerful social message that can greatly benefit social cohesion 1 young h peyton 1990 progressive taxation and equal sacrifice the american economic review 80 1 253 266 2 benabou roland social mobility and the demand for redistribution the poum hypothesis the quarterly journal of economics 2001 available
test-economy-thsptr-con02a,progressive taxes place an unfair and disproportionate burden on the wealthy the revenues the state acquires through taxation are used to pay for various services and benefices lower income individuals consume these services to a disproportionate degree it is they who require income supplements and child benefits when they lack the wherewithal to provide for themselves and they avail more readily than the wealthy of such things as public healthcare and transport services there is thus clearly no correlation between the amount people pays in taxes and amount of benefits they receive from them 1 the rich make less use of such services often preferring to use of privately provided services yet they are expected to pay a greater proportion of their wealth to the public services they do not use under a progressive system of taxation as a matter of fairness it is only just that everyone contribute to the provision of public services equally in accordance with their wherewithal to do so wealthier people thus can pay more units of wealth to the system than poor people justly but when they are expected to pay a disproportionate percentage of wealth through a system that levies contributions according to a progressive rather than proportional scale they are being used unfairly and being stripped of their rightful possessions to the use of others 1 mayer david wealthy americans deserve real tax relief on principle 7 5 1999 available

test-economy-thsptr-con04a,progressive systems are invariably highly complex and inefficient in implementation breeding the knock on inefficiencies of evasion and avoidance the modern progressive tax system has created whole industries of firms and specialists geared toward helping people file their taxes and to ensure the system runs smoothly it has also bred armies of officials who oversee and audit tax issues costing the united states for example more than 11 billion a year to operate its tax collection and verification systems 1 people are forced under the progressive system to waste hours filling out returns to hoard and sift through receipts to be accurate and to maximize their rebates there is thus a huge efficiency loss in terms of people s time as they are forced to dedicate effort and resources to the often arduous task of filing taxes in an ever more complicated system arising from a progressive regime the extreme complexity of the system has generated further negative incentives encouraging the wealthy to seek ways around the system to exploit loopholes in the bloated system for their personal benefit 2 the very wealthy can thus evade obligations through the manipulation of complex tax codes and loopholes and can sometimes even lead less scrupulous people to pay less than less wealthy people flat and regressive consumption taxes on the other hand offer an easier mechanism of taxation that is easier to understand less time consuming to deal with and harder to manipulate 1 white james internal revenue service assessment of the 2008 budget request and an update of 2007 performance united states government accountability office available 2 wolk martin why the tax system keeps getting more complex msnbc 2006 available

test-economy-egppphbcb-con03a,socialism is a more secure system than the free market in capitalism credit bubbles and resultant credit crunches financial crisis are inherent in the capitalist system the economy undergoes a crisis whenever productive economic sectors begin to undergo a slowdown resulting in falls in profits the recent crisis was caused due to the fact that there was an inflated investment in real estates it was invested in with the purpose of keeping up profits which lead to a rise in the price of properties because of the increased price in property many people took out loans on their house and bought goods for the credit thinking they could easily pay back their loans since their house would be more valuable at sale however since the rise of price was fabricated and not corresponding to an actual need it was a bubble house prices had to invariably go down at some point when the prices eventually went down people could no longer afford to pay back what they had bought on their loaned houses and the installed payments were the trigger of the financial crisis it could perhaps be said that the economy was surviving on money which did not exist thereof the name credit bubble the result was that there were countless goods which no one could buy because no one could afford to pay for them in turn this lead to a stagnation in the economy and hence to a crisis a socialist system would not produce overconsumption since its aim is not profit but human needs it would not have a reason to fabricate an investment for the sake of keeping up the profits and would therefore not cause a capitalist crisis1 1 roberts m 2008 the credit crunch one year on in defence of marxism retrieved june 7 2011

test-international-gmehbisrip1b-con01a,israel has the right to claim minimal territory to ensure security israel has been the victim of multiple major illegal wars of aggression on the part of the arab world most notably in 1948 and 1967 these wars invalidate any special claim made by arabs and palestinians to pre 1967 territory and justify israel in keeping as much territory as is necessary to secure itself against these hostile states israel could have gone much further and taken more territory than it did in 1967 as it was easily winning the war but instead it restricted itself to only taking the territory that was necessary for it to create security buffer 1 when peace deals have allowed israel to improve its security through giving up land historically it has done so for example when it returned the sinai peninsula to egypt in 1982 in exchange for a peace treaty with egypt or when israel returned the small swath of jordanian territory it held when king hussain of jordan wanted to make peace to date israel has withdrawn from approximately 93 percent of the territories it captured in return for peace with syria and an end to palestinian terror it is prepared to withdraw from most of the remaining 7 in dispute although not all israel remains committed to trading land for peace and never annexed the west bank or gaza strip because it expected to return part of these territories in negotiations when the palestinians finally declared that they would recognize israel and renounce terrorism israel agreed to begin to withdraw since 1993 israel has turned over approximately 80 of the gaza strip and more than 40 of the west bank to the palestinian authority thus israel s objection is not so much against returning any of the land captured in 1967 but against returning absolutely all of it and going back completely to the 1967 borders as this would mean giving up territories vital for israel s security the minimal slivers of territory that israel it seeks to maintain through a peace settlement after returning 90 of the pre 1967 territory is very important to its national security as it offers a buffer against future arab wars of aggression this why ehud olmert stressed that only most of the occupied territory could be returned he still argued that some had to be kept for security reasons we can never totally return to the indefensible pre 1967 borders we simply cannot afford to make israel 9 miles wide again at its center we can t allow the palestinians to be a couple miles from tel aviv s ben gurion airport in the age of shoulder fire missiles with the capacity to shoot down jumbo jets 2 moreover israel is in an anomalous situation it is an embattled democracy that historically has had to defend itself repeatedly against the armies of neighbouring arab states whose declared goal was nothing less than israel s eradication the israel defense forces could not afford to miscalculate while other nations like france or kuwait have been overrun occupied and nonetheless have survived to reconstitute themselves israel in contrast cannot depend on obtaining a second chance miscalculation on its part could have had devastating consequences and thus its situation is unique 3 for this critical purpose of national survival therefore the annexed land serves a legally legitimate purpose especially considering that the arab wars of aggression were what caused the annexation of the land in the first place in such circumstances a nation that won a defensive war has a right to set terms to ensure against future wars of aggression 1 johnson paul a history of the jews weidenfeld and nicolson 1987 2 thinkexist com ehud olmert quotes thinkexist com 3 amidror maj gen res yaakov israel s requirement for defensible borders defensible borders for a lasting peace 2005

test-international-ghwcitca-con02a,a treaty would benefit larger powers over the small any treaty that seeks to ban cyber attacks would simply be an attempt to cement the position of the most powerful countries at the expense of weaker ones this is because cyber attacks are like terrorism weapons that can be used by anyone to attack a much bigger target to launch a cyber attack there is little need for training only a small amount of comparatively cheap equipment to military hardware at any rate and an internet connection 1 and it is difficult to defend against this makes it ideal for poor nations to maintain cyber warfare as a credible threat to their bigger neighbours while their neighbours threaten them conventionally with their bigger militaries we have seen before arms treaties that are fundamentally biased in favour of a small group of powerful states most notable is the nuclear non proliferation treaty where there are five recognised nuclear weapons states who are allowed the horrific weapons and everyone else is banned from having them this discrimination was accepted as a result of the agreement that the nuclear weapons states would eventually disarm it has not happened so leaving a troubled treaty system that appears to be regularly flouted 2 1 phillips andrew t now hear this the asymmetric nature of cyber warfare u s naval institute vol 138 10 1316 october 2012 2 miller steven e nuclear collisions discord reform amp the nuclear nonproliferation regime american academy of arts amp sciences 2012

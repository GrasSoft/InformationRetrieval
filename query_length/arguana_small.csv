test-environment-aeghhgwpe-pro04a,being vegetarian reduces risks of food poisoning almost all dangerous types of food poisoning are passed on through meat or eggs so campylobacter bacteria the most common cause of food poisoning in england are usually found in raw meat and poultry unpasteurised milk and untreated water salmonella come from raw meat poultry and dairy products and most cases of escherichia coli e coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef or drinking unpasteurised milk 1 close contact between humans and animals also leads to zoonosis diseases such as bird flu which can be passed on from animals to humans using animal brains in the processed feed for livestock led to bse in cattle and to cjd in humans who ate beef from infected cows 1 causes of food poisoning nhs co uk 23rd june 2009
test-environment-aeghhgwpe-con02a,there are problems with being vegetarian a vegetarian or vegan diet may result in a person not getting enough iron this is because although you can get iron from foods such as pulses green leafy vegetables and nuts the iron in these foods isn t absorbed so easily the symptoms of this feeling breathless after little exercise feeling tired and a short attention span and poor concentration 1 these symptoms could negatively affect proficiency in school and the ability to perform well at work ultimately leading to a loss of productivity which has both personal effects and broader effects for the economy other conditions include frequently becoming ill frequently becoming depressed and malnourishment 1 bupa s health information team iron deficiency anaemia bupa co uk march 2010
test-environment-aeghhgwpe-con03a,survival of the fittest it is natural for human beings to farm kill and eat other species in the wild there is a brutal struggle for existence as is shown by darwin s on the origin of the species 1 the fact that we humans have succeeded in that struggle by exploiting our natural environment means that we have a natural right over lower species the concept of survival of the fittest may seem outdated but it is still the defining order of nature in fact farming animals is much less brutal than the pain and hardship that animals inflict on each other naturally in the wild 1 darwin charles on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life literature org
test-environment-assgbatj-pro02a,animal research causes severe harm to the animals involved the point of animal research is that animals are harmed even if they don t suffer in the experiment almost all are killed afterwards with 115 million animals used a year this is a big problem releasing medical research animals in to the wild would be dangerous for them and they would not be usable as pets 4 the only solution is that they are wild from birth it is obvious that it s not in the interest of animals to be killed or harmed research should be banned in order to prevent the deaths of millions of animals
test-environment-assgbatj-pro05a,it would send out a consistent message most countries have animal welfare laws to prevent animal cruelty but have laws like the uk s animals scientific procedures act 1986 10 that stop animal testing being a crime this makes means some people can do things to animals but not others if the government are serious about animal abuse why allow anyone to do it
test-environment-assgbatj-pro01a,animals shouldn t be harmed the difference between us and other animals is a matter of degree rather than type 2 their bodies resemble ours as do their ways of conveying meaning they recoil from pain appear to express fear of a tormentor and appear to take pleasure in activities a point clear to anyone who has observed a pet dog on hearing the word walk we believe other people experience feelings like us because they are like us in appearance and behaviour an animal sharing our anatomical physiological and behavioural characteristics is surely likely to have feelings like us if people have a right to not be harmed we must ask ourselves what makes animals different if animals feel what we feel and suffer like us to condemn one to testing because of them being of a different species is similar to racism or sexism 3
test-environment-assgbatj-pro03a,it isn t necessary we don t know how we will be able to develop new drugs without animal testing until we end it we now know how most chemicals work and computer simulations of chemicals are very good 6 experimenting on tissue can show how drugs work without the need for actual animals even skin left over from surgery can be experiment on and being human is more useful the fact that animal research was needed in the past isn t a good excuse any more we still have all the advancements from animal testing in the past but it s no longer needed 7
test-environment-assgbatj-pro04a,most animals can suffer more than some people it s possible to think of people that can t suffer like those in a persistent vegetative state or with significant intellectual disabilities we could go for one of three options either we could experiment on animals but not such people which is morally not consistent we could allow both but do we want to do painful medical research on the disabled or we could do neither 9
test-environment-assgbatj-con02a,people will die if we don t do animal testing every year 23 new drugs are introduced in the uk alone 13 almost all will be tested on animals a new drug will be used for a long time think of all the people saved by the use of penicillin if drugs cost more to test that means drug companies will develop less this means more people suffering and dying
test-environment-assgbatj-con05a,research animals are well treated animals used in research generally don t suffer while they may be in pain they are generally given pain killers and when they are put down this is done humanely 16 they are looked after as healthy animals mean better experimental results these animals live better lives than they would in the wild as long as animals are treated well there shouldn t be a moral objection to animal research this is exactly the same as with raising animals that will be used for meat
test-environment-assgbatj-con04a,animal research is only used when it s needed eu member states and the us have laws to stop animals being used for research if there is any alternative the 3rs principles are commonly used animal testing is being refined for better results and less suffering replaced and reduced in terms of the number of animals used this means that less animals have to suffer and the research is better
test-environment-assgbatj-con03a,testing is needed for really new drugs the real benefit of animal testing is making totally new drugs which is about a quarter of them after non animal and then animal tests it will be tested on humans the reason why the risk is low but not non existent for these brave volunteers is because of the animal tests these new chemicals are the ones most likely to produce improvements to people s lives because they are new you couldn t do research on these new drugs without either animal testing or putting humans at a much higher risk
test-environment-assgbatj-con01a,animals don t have human rights humans have large brains form social groups communicate and are generally worthy of moral consideration we also are aware of ourselves and of the nature of death some animals have some of these characteristics but not all so should not have the same rights in harming animals to benefit humans we enter in to a good moral trade off to create a greater good 11
test-environment-aiahwagit-pro02a,poaching is becoming more advanced a stronger militarised approach is needed as poaching is becoming far more advanced poachers now operate with high calibre rifles night vision scopes silencers and use helicopters to hunt their prey 1 these methods are used particularly against rhinoceroses in south africa whose horns have become extremely valuable on the asian market for their supposed medical properties 2 in response to this south african rangers are being given specialised training and use their own aerial surveillance to track poachers down with success 3 supporting the argument for a militarised response to protect endangered animals 1 wwf african rhino poaching crisis 2 zapwing the rhino poaching crisis 3 ibid
test-environment-aiahwagit-pro05a,the justice system does not currently work a major failing in current anti poaching operations is that the poachers are rarely prosecuted african legal systems rarely prioritise poaching as a serious crime with offenders usually receiving trivial fines1 one of the major reasons for the western black rhinoceros extinction in 2011 was the complete lack of sentencing for any of the poachers who were captured 1 the system also fails to prosecute the brains behind many of the operations due to poor investigative methods this creates an impression in the minds of the poachers that they can operate with impunity 2 1 mathur a western black rhino poached out of existence declared extinct slack anti poaching efforts responsible 2 welz a the war on african poaching is militarization fated to fail
test-environment-aiahwagit-pro01a,natural habitats being are destroyed a tougher approach to the protection of animals is needed to prevent their natural habitats from being destroyed by locals as humans expand their agricultural activity in africa they are destroying the environments of endangered animals and pushing others towards being endangered due to an increase in large scale cotton plantations and food crops the west african lion has seen a marked decrease in population numbering less than 400 in early 2014 1 tougher protection such as fencing off areas from human activity has been suggested and has seen success in south africa 2 1 bbc lions facing extinction in west africa 2 morelle r fencing off wild lions from humans could save them
test-environment-aiahwagit-pro03a,endangered animals are a source of pride for african countries endangered animals warrant a tougher degree of protection in africa as they have notable cultural significance some groups believe that african elephants have mystic powers attached to them and have coveted them for centuries 1 african lions have been depicted on the coat of arms for states and institutions both past and present 2 they are intrinsically linked with africa s past and its identity the extinction of these animals therefore would have a negative cultural impact and should be prevented 1 university of california los angeles elephant the animal and its ivory in african culture 2 coleman q the importance of african lions
test-environment-aiahwagit-pro04a,poaching is linked to terrorism stronger protection of animals should be implemented to reduce the funding for terrorist groups certain terrorist organisations use the illegal ivory and horn trade as funding for their operations al shabaab the lord s resistance army lra and the sudanese janjaweed all use the illicit trade as a source of income with the former using the trade for 40 of its expenditure 1 this enables them to carry out attacks such as the 2013 westgate siege in kenya 2 tougher protection of endangered animals would reduce the ability of these groups to fund themselves in turn this would decrease their operational capability increasing stability in africa 1 stewart c illegal ivory trade funds al shabaab s terrorist attacks 2 tackett c how elephant poaching helped fund kenya terrorist attack
test-environment-aiahwagit-con02a,fewer human deaths fewer large beasts will lead to fewer deaths in africa some endangered animals are aggressive and will attack humans hippopotamuses kill in excess of three hundred humans a year in africa with other animals such as the elephant and lion also causing many fatalities 1 footage released in early 2014 of a bull elephant attacking a tourist s car in kruger national park south africa demonstrated the continued threat these animals cause 2 tougher protection would result in higher numbers of these animals which increases the risk to human lives 1 animal danger most dangerous animals 2 withnall a rampaging bull elephant flips over british tourist car in kruger park
test-environment-aiahwagit-con01a,african countries have little money to spare africa has some of the least developed countries in the world making extensive protection of endangered animals unviable many african countries are burdened by the more pressing issues of civil war large debts poverty and economic underdevelopment 1 these factors already draw significant amounts of money from limited budgets tanzania for example has revenue of 5 571 billion and an expenditure of 6 706 billion 2 increased expenditure on animal protection projects would only serve to worsen this budget deficit 1 simensen j africa the causes of under development and the challenges of globalisation 2 the world factbook tanzania

test-environment-opecewiahw-pro02a,an immense boost to drc s economy the grand inga dam would be an immense boost to the drc s economy it would mean a huge amount of investment coming into the country as almost all the 80 billion construction cost would be coming from outside the country which would mean thousands of workers employed and spending money in the drc as well as boosting local suppliers once the project is complete the dam will provide cheap electricity so making industry more competitive and providing electricity to homes even the initial stages through inga iii are expected to provide electricity for 25 000 households in kinshasa 1 1 movement on the grand inga hydropower project ujuh 20 november 2013
test-environment-opecewiahw-pro04a,a dam could make the congo more usable while the congo is mostly navigable it is only usable internally the rapids cut the middle congo off from the sea the building of the dams could be combined with canalisation and locks to enable international goods to be easily transported to and from the interior this would help integrate central africa economically into the global economy making the region much more attractive for investment
test-environment-opecewiahw-con02a,a dam would damage the environment dams due to their generation of renewable electricity are usually seen as environmentally friendly but such mega projects are rarely without consequences the grand inga would lower the oxygen content of the lower course of the river which would mean a loss of species this would not only affect the river as the congo s delta is a submerged area of 300 000km2 far out into the atlantic this system is not yet understood but the plume transmits sediment and organic matter into the atlantic ocean encouraging plankton offshore contributing to the atlantic s ability to be a carbon sink 1 1 showers kate will africa s mega dam have mega impacts international rivers 5 march 2012

test-health-hdond-pro04a,people ought to donate their organs anyway organ donation in all its forms saves lives more to the point it saves lives with almost no loss to the donor one obviously has no material need for one s organs after death and thus it does not meaningfully inhibit bodily integrity to incentivize people to give up their organs at this time if one is registered as an organ donor every attempt is still made to save their life organ donation faq the state is always more justified in demanding beneficial acts of citizens if the cost to the citizen is minimal this is why the state can demand that people wear seatbelts but cannot conscript citizens for use as research subjects because there is no good reason not to become an organ donor the state ought to do everything in its power to ensure that people do so
test-health-hdond-con02a,this system will punish people for a past decision they cannot now undo most formulations of this policy involve assessing donor status on the basis of whether the patient was a registered organ donor prior to needing an organ thus a sick person could find themselves in the tortuous situation of sincerely regretting their past decision not to donate but having no means to atone for their past act to visit such a situation upon citizens not only meaningfully deprives them of the means to continue living it subjects them to great psychological distress indeed they are not only aware that their past passive decision not to register as a donor has doomed them but they are constantly told by the state that this is well and just
test-health-hdond-con04a,people may have valid religious reasons not to donate organs many major religions such as some forms of orthodox judaism haredim issue specifically mandate leaving the body intact after death to create a system that aims to strongly pressure people with the threat of reduced priority for life saving treatment to violate their religious beliefs violates religious freedom this policy would put individuals and families in the untenable position of having to choose between contravene the edicts of their god and losing the life of themselves or a loved one while it could be said that any religion that bans organ donation would presumably ban receiving organs as transplants this is not actually the case some followers of shintoism and roma faiths prohibit removing organs from the body but allow transplants to the body
test-health-hdond-con03a,denying organs to non donors is unduly coercive for the state to make organ donation mandatory is rightly seen as beyond the pale of what society would tolerate this is because the right to the integrity of one s body including what is done with its component parts after death must be held in the highest respect undhr article 3 re security of person one s body is one s most foundational possession creating a system that effectively threatens death to anyone who refuses to donate part of their body is only marginally different from making it outright mandatory the state s goal is in effect the same to compel citizens to give up their organs for a purpose the government has deemed socially worthwhile this is a gross violation of body rights
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-pro02a,if personhood accrues at birth then abortion after inducing birth is wrong if birth is the crucial dividing line we use to decide when legal personhood begins then we should not be allowed to induce birth and then deliberately kill a foetus during that process this is different from early abortion in which birth is induced and the foetus dies naturally partial birth abortion is murder even on the pro choice understanding of personhood
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-pro01a,the foetus feels pain partial birth abortion is disgusting like all abortions it involves the killing of an unborn child but unlike first trimester abortions there is no doubt that the foetus can feel pain by the third trimester 1 the procedure involves sticking a pair of scissors into a baby s brain enlarging the hole sucking the brain out with a catheter and then crushing the skull it is entirely unacceptable to do this to a living human being psychological damage to the mother as a result of rape or teenage pregnancy or depression is in the end less significant than the physical damage death caused to the child 1 lee susan j et al fetal pain a systematic multidisciplinary review of the evidence journal of the american medical association vol 294 8 2005
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-pro03a,abortion is wrong per se when there are alternatives such as adoption tragically some babies are unwanted but this does not mean that we should kill them there are plenty of other options notably adoption if anything the case for adoption is more compelling in the third trimester because the pregnancy is nearer to its natural end and there is less time only about ten weeks for the mother to have to put up with it 1 unwanted pregnancy and adoption may be psychologically harmful but in many cases so is abortion particularly at a late stage of pregnancy when the mother can see that the dead foetus is recognisably a baby the guilt feelings associated with feeling that one is responsible for murdering a child can be unbearable 1 bupa stages of pregnancy april 2010
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-pro04a,banning partial birth abortions is in line with popular and accepted moral standards here is a vast amount of support in the united states for a ban on partial birth abortion opinion polls have shown a consistent increase in support for a ban as high as 70 in favour to 25 against in january 2003 1 furthermore in 1997 the house of representatives voted 295 136 and the senate 64 36 in favour of a ban for president clinton to veto it was undemocratic 2 for president bush not to pass it would have been to break a campaign promise 1 gallup abortion 30 november 2011 2 craig larry e clinton claims on partial birth abortion still not true not even legally accurate united states senate republican policy committee 15 september 1998
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-con02a,opposition to partial birth abortion is part of a strategy intended to ban abortion in general partial birth abortions form a tiny proportion of all abortions but from a medical and psychological point of view they ought to be the least controversial the reason for this focus is that late term abortions are the most obviously distasteful because late term foetuses look more like babies than embryos or foetuses at an earlier developmental stage late term abortions therefore make for the best pro life campaigning material by attempting to focus the debate here campaigners are aiming to conflate all abortions with late term abortions and to increase opposition to all abortion on that basis
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-con03a,partial birth abortions are safer than any available alternative the d amp x abortion procedure generates the minimum of risk for the mother banning it means that the only alternatives are premature labour induction for which mortality rates are 2 5 times higher and is emotionally very difficult due to the length of time it takes 1 it is also likely to be unacceptable to the proposition and hysterotomy which results in removal of the womb finally as those who are having late partial birth abortions are likely to be suicidal or at least will be very determined to get rid of their child they are the most likely to resort to back street methods that cause damage to themselves 1 the harriet and robert heilbrunn department of population and family health abortion
test-health-ppelfhwbpba-con01a,the concept of foetal rights is an attack on the autonomy of women the culture of foetal rights reflects a dangerous litigious trend in american society and implies a view of pregnant women as being nothing more than baby carrying machines whose independence and autonomy should be restricted and whose motivations should be questioned at every turn if this has implications for the abortion debate then those implications are profoundly damaging to women in general in any case the mother of a wanted baby has entirely different responsibilities toward the unborn foetus from the mother of an unwanted baby that s why our society allows both abortions and antenatal classes

test-health-dhgsshbesbc-pro04a,tackling hiv requires a responsible and active position by everyone businesses ought to take a responsible and active position on hiv the issue isn t going to go away successful programs designed to help hiv positive employees remain in the workplace for as long as they want to do so should be developed procedures for treating personnel with fairness and dignity must be put in place the potential fears and prejudices of other employees must be combated the beginning of that process is ensuring they know about the problem and crucially the scale of it without knowledge of the numbers involved employers may put in place inadequate medical and pensions arrangements that will ultimately prove inadequate
test-health-dhgsshbesbc-con03a,it is a disincentive to get tested in the first place the requirement to disclose their condition if known would be a disincentive to get tested in the first place this is especially the case for many people in places like sub saharan africa but also applies widely elsewhere their job is so important to them since there s no safety net to speak of if they lose it that they d prefer to go in ignorance of their hiv status than find out and risk being fired for it the medical repercussions of that are obvious

test-health-dhiacihwph-pro04a,unfair to apply same patent laws universally it is unrealistic to expect poorer countries such as those in africa to pay the same price as the developed world s markets current patent laws for many countries dictate that prices for buying patented drugs should be universally the same this makes it extremely difficult for african countries to purchase pharmaceuticals set at the market price of developed countries in the us there are nine patented drugs which cost in excess of 200 000 1 to expect developing african states to afford this price is unfair and reinforces the exploitative relationship between the developed and developing world generic drugs escape this problem due to their universally low prices 1 herper m the world s most expensive drugs

test-health-hpehwadvoee-con02a,the recipient is forced to receive the sacrifice of another in many cases the recipient is not in position to consent to the donation thus even if it saves his or her life it is comes with an intrusion on his or her moral integrity that he or she might value higher than survival if we are to receive such a drastic sacrifice from someone that we love surely we must have a right to veto it 1 this means that to enable the choice of the donor the choice of the receiver has been ignored there seems to be little reason to simply switch those two positions around as is proposed 1 monforte royo c et al the wish to hasten death a review of clinical studies psycho oncology 20 8 2011 795 804

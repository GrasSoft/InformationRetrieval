test-health-hdond-pro02a,prioritizing donors creates an incentive to become a donor the greatest argument for this policy is also the simplest it will save thousands perhaps millions of lives a policy of prioritizing transplants for donors would massively increase the proportion of donors from the status quo of at best just over 30 confirmed organ donors given the number of people who die under circumstances that render many of their organs useless the rate of donor registration must be as high as possible the overwhelming incentive that this policy would create to register may well eliminate the scarcity for certain organs altogether a bonus benefit of this would mean that for organs where the scarcity was eliminated this policy would not even need to make good on its threat of denial of organs to non donors and even if this happened for every organ and thus reduced the incentive to register as a donor the number of donors could only fall as far as until there was a scarcity again thus reviving the incentive to donate until the rate of donation reaches an equilibrium with demand

test-sport-ybfgsohbhog-con02a,the bidding process is too long tying up funds and land the bidding process takes too long bidding officially takes only two years unless a city fails to make the shortlist but most cities spend nearly a decade working on their bids obviously the bidding process costs money but it also ties up the land needed for any future olympic village or stadia from being developed until the bid outcome is known as well as diverting government funds away from other sporting events and activities furthermore the way the ioc works with each member deciding which city they wish to vote for means that personal relationships and international tension can count for more than the quality of the bid for example american foreign policy is thought to be disadvantaging new york in the 2012 bidding process given that the olympics are rotated between continents if a city fails to be selected it will be 12 years before it has another chance

test-international-amehbuaisji-pro01a,the icc is a force for good and the all states should be seen to be standing fully behind it the international criminal court is a major breakthrough in providing a permanent and durable system that can effectively prosecute and independently try war criminals in the past there was no permanent framework for dealing with grave breaches of human rights protection often allowing states to perform evil acts with impunity only for the very worst atrocities were special courts and tribunals set up it should also act as a deterrent to future violations it may not reduce conflict but will encourage states to keep a tighter rein on their militaries an attempt at a solution to the problem of enforcement of international criminal law is something to be applauded for the same reason the criminal law on the domestic sphere is it saves lives protects human rights and provides civilization to what would otherwise be anarchy
test-international-amehbuaisji-con04a,icc trials violate the due process guarantees of the us constitution us ratification of the rome statute would lead to the possibility of americans being subject to trials with procedures that violate the american constitution for example there are no jury trials at the icc a majority vote of the judges is enough to convict is a violation of the sixth amendment to the us constitution the independence and neutrality of some of the judges may be doubtful if they come from countries with definite foreign policy interests that run contrary to those of the us this is particularly pertaining to judges who are from backgrounds where judicial independence from the executive is not a defining feature of the legal system who will be more likely swayed by political considerations there is in addition a lack of rules against double jeopardy and the glacial rate of progress made by the icc with lengthy waits in pre trial detention for defendants affecting the right to a speedy trial it has also been argued that the procedures for special measures to protect witnesses hamper the defence

test-international-amehbuaisji-con01a,ratification of the international criminal court would be a violation of national sovereignty any state ratifying the rome statute is placing its citizens at the mercy of a court that operates outside of national control this is an unacceptable ceding of national sovereignty thus no state other than the us has the power to deal with american criminals and no one but israel should deal with israeli criminals international criminal law and national sovereignty are inevitably enemies not only does the icc threaten american sovereignty it threatens the sovereignty of all nations the icc can in some cases prosecute citizens of nations that are not state parties authority for justice within one s territory is however at the heart of the concept of sovereignty as a matter of principle the us should not be supporting measures that affect the sovereignty of any nation let alone the us itself

test-international-aghwrem-con02a,the international community and political legitimacy the military controlled government in myanmar clearly does not have popular domestic support otherwise the artificial election process would not have been necessary therefore it derives its strength from the fact that many international players other than the us and the eu have continued to recognise it while there is historic precedent for concerted international opinion having influenced illegitimate regimes haiti and south africa for instance having a nationalised economy increases the control the military has over trade and investment while a majority of the country finds itself in poverty the choice for the international community is between continuing to strengthen the military by engaging with it or by disengaging like the eu and the us until the ruling elite runs out of resources and options the former option does not give hope to any real democratic reform while the latter option would take away the legitimacy of the government in the international arena
test-international-aghwrem-con03a,re engagement will weaken the reform movement international and domestic pressure has forced the military junta to set up a nominal civilian government it is important to make sure that change goes further and becomes meaningful this will involve bringing into force a fair constitution curbing human rights violations and bringing its perpetrators to justice and creating conditions for legitimate democratic elections to take place by reengaging at this juncture the signal the ruling elite in myanmar will get is that this piecemeal nominal change is sufficient to hold them in good stead in the international political arena for a longer period it would also be a betrayal of the pro democracy supporters in myanmar who continue to be cast out of the constitutional process and have little actual political influence under the existing system 1 1 thanegi ma burma sanctions the case against bbc news 4 march 2002

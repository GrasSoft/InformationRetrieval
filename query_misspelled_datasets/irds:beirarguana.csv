rivers beef farming is one of the main causes of deforestation and as long as people continue to buy fast food in their billions there will be a financial incentive to continue cutting down trees to make room for cattle because of our desire to eat fish our rivers and seas are being emptied of fish and many species are facing extinction energy resources are used up much more greedily by meat farming than my farming cereals pulses etc eating meat and fish not only causes cruelty to animals it causes serious harm to the environment and to biodiversity for example consider meat production

test-health-hdond-pro01a,a practical solution there are many mechanisms by which this policy could be implemented the one common thread is that those hoping to receive organs would be divided into those registered as donors and those who are non donors potential recipients who are non donors would only receive an organ if all requests by donors for such an organ are filled for example if there is a scarcity of donated kidneys with the b serotype organ donors requiring a b kidney would all receive kidneys before any non donors receive them the existing metrics for deciding priority among recipients can still be applied within these lists among both donors and non donors individuals could be ranked on who receives an organ first based on who has been on the waiting list longer or who has more priority based on life expectancy this policy simply adds the caveat that non donors only access organs once all donors for their particular organ are satisfied what defines a donor could vary it could be that they must have been a donor for a certain number of years or that they must have been a donor prior to needing a transplant or even a pledge to become a donor henceforth and indeed even if they are terminally ill and for other reasons do not recover some of their organs may still be usable finally this policy need not preclude private donations or swaps of organs and instead can simply be applied to the public system,a practic solution thee are many mehanisms by whih his policy could be mplemntd the one common thad is tha those hopng o receie oans would be divided into those rgistered as donors and those ho are n donors potetal recipint who are non donor would only receiv an organ if all requests by doors for such n organ are filld or example if their is a scarcity o donated kidneys ith the b serotype og donors requring a b kidney would all receive kidnys beore any no donors recieve tm the eistng metris for deciding priority among recipins can still b appled within these lits amon oth donors and no donrs ndividuals could be rnkd on who receies an organ first based on who has been on the waiting lst longer or who has more prioriy based on life expectancy thi policy sipy adds the caveat that non donors nly cces organs once all donors for heir partilar organ are satisfied wht defines a donor coul vary it cold be that they must have ben a donor for a certain nmbr of years or that they must have en a donor prior to needing a transplan or even a pledge t become a dono hencefoth and indeed eve if they are terminally ill and for othe reasons o not recer sme of thir organs may sti be sble finly this policy eed ot preclude private dontions or saps of orgns and nstead can simply be applied to th public system

test-health-dhghwapgd-pro03a,production of generic drugs reduce medical costs by allowing increased production and the development of superior production methods increasing market efficiency the sale of generic drugs invariably reduces costs to consumers this is due to two reasons it may be the case that an individual or firm with a patent essentially a monopoly right to the production of something may not have the ability to efficiently go about meeting demand for it patents slow or even stop the dissemination of the production methods especially when a patent holder is unwilling to license production to others1 such an outcome is deleterious to society as with no restrictions on drug production an efficient producer or producers will emerge to meet the needs of the public producing an amount of drugs commensurate with demand and thus equilibrating market price with that demand2 this market equilibration is impossible under conventional patent laws as it is in the interest of firms to withhold production and to engage in monopolist rent seeking from consumers3 this leads firms to deliberately under produce which they have been shown to do in many cases as for example the case of miacalcic a drug used to treat paget s disease in which its producer deliberately kept production down in order to keep prices high4 when a firm is given monopoly power over a drug it has the ability to abuse it and history shows that is what they are wont to do by allowing the production of generic drugs this monopoly power is broken and people can get the drugs they need at costs that are not marked far above their free market value 1 kinsella stephan 2010 patents kill compulsory licenses and genzyme s life saving drug mises institute available 2stim rishand 2006 profit from your idea how to make smart licensing decisions berkeley nolo 3 lee timothy 2007 patent rent seeking cato at liberty available 4 flanders today 2010 big pharma denies strategic shortages flanders today,production f generc drug redue medical csts b allowin increased prduction and the devlopment f supror producion methos inceasing market efficiency the sale o generic drugs invariably redces costs t consumer hs s de to two reasons it may e the case that an individual or firm with a paten essentially a onoply right to the prdction of someing may not have the abiity to efficienly go abot meeting mnd or it patets slow or even top the isseinaio of the producio ethods especialy when a patent holder is unilling to license prodution to others1 such a outcome s delterious to soety s with no restrictions on drug prodction an effiient producer r producers will emerge to met the needs of th ublic poducing an mun of drugs commnsuate with demnd nd hus euilibatng market price wih that demnd2 this market equilibrtion is impossbe nder cnvetioal patent laws s it is in the nterst of firms to wthold prduction and to engage in monopolist rent seeking from nsumrs3 this leads firms to deliberatly nder produce which they hv been sown to do i may ases as for example the cas of miacalcic a drug used to treat page s dsease in which its producer deliberately kept production ow in orer to keep price hih hen a firm is ien monopy poer over a du it has the ablity to abuse t an hisor shows tht s wat they are wont to o b allwin te producton of generic drugs this moopoly oer i broken and people an get the drugs tey ned at cots that are not mrked fr above their free maket value 1 kinsella sphan 2010 paents kil cmpulsory licens and genzyme s lie savig rug mises institute available 2stim rishan 20 pofit fro your idea w to make smart licensing decision berley olo 3 lee timothy 2007 patent rent seeking cato at lierty available 4 flanders oay 010 big phma dnies strategic shrtages fadrs oday

test-health-dhghwapgd-con04a,robust drug patent laws incentivize investment of time and money in developing new products when a real chance of profit exists in the development of a new product or drug people and firms put the effort into developing and creating them the incentive to profit drives a great deal of people s intellectual endeavors research and development for example forms a major part of industries investment as they seek to create new products and inventions that will benefit consumers and thus society as a whole research and development is extremely costly however the us pharmaceutical industry alone spends tens of billions of dollars every year on researching new drugs1 the fear of theft or of lack of profit stemming from such research will serve as a powerful disincentive to investment without the protection of patents new drugs lose much of their value since a second comer on the field can simply take the formula and develop the same product without the heavy costs of research involved leaving the innovative company worse off than its copycat competitor this will lead to far less innovation and will hamper companies currently geared toward innovative and progressive products patent protection is particularly important to companies with high fixed costs and low marginal costs such as pharmaceutical firms without the guarantee of ownership over intellectual products the incentive to invest in their development is diminished as they will not be guaranteed a payback for their research costs as a competitor could simply take the product off them within a robust patents system firms compete to produce the best product for patenting and licensing that will give them a higher market share and allow them to reap high profits these incentives lead firms to invent around one another s patents leading to gradual improvements in drugs and treatments benefiting all consumers2 without patents the drugs companies are trapped in a kind of prisoners dilemma where both are individually better off by refusing to innovate yet both suffer if neither innovates patents are the solution to this if a company innovates it alone can reap the rewards of the new invention3 in the absence of patent protection there is no incentive to develop new drugs meaning in the long run more people will suffer from diseases and ailments that might have

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro02a,hate speech the enforcement of the laws proposed in this article will be fraught complex and difficult however the difficulty of administering a law is never a good argument for refusing to enforce it the censorship of the written word ended in england with the lady chatterley and oz obscenity trials but this liberalisation of publication standards has not prevented the state from prosecuting hate speech when it appears in print it is clear that although we have more latitude than ever to say or write what we want no matter how objectionable standards and taboos continue to exist we can take it that these taboos are especially important and valuable to the running of a stable society as they have persisted despite the legal and cultural changes that have taken place over the last fifty years hate speech is prosecuted and censored because of its power to intrude into the lives of individuals who have not consented to receive it as pointed out in jeremy waldron s response 1 to timothy garton ash s piece 2 on hate speech hateful comments are not dangerous because they insight gullible individuals to abandon their inhibitions and engage in race riots hate speech is harmful because it recreates cheaply and in front of a very large audience an atmosphere in which vulnerable minorities are put in fear of becoming the targets of violence and prejudice additionally hate speech harms by defaming groups by propagating lies and half truths about practices and beliefs with the objective of socially isolating those groups gangsta rap does all of these things yet legal responses to the publication of songs containing such lyrics as rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome have been timid at best even if we maintain our liberal approach to taboo breaking forms of expression we can still link hip hop to many of the harms that hate speech produces gangsta rap gives the impression that african american and latin american neighbourhoods throughout the usa are violent lawless places even if the pronouncements of rappers such as 50 cent and nwa are overblown or fictitious they enforce social division by vividly discouraging people from entering or interacting with poor minority communities they damage those communities directly by creating a fear of criminality that serves to limit trust and cohesion among individual community members finally violent hip hop is also defamatory it propagates an image of minority communities that emphasises violence poverty and nihilism whilst loudly proclaiming its authenticity it is completely irrelevant that these images of minority communities are produced by members of those communities it is on this basis however protracted the process of classification must become that the content of hip hop songs should be assessed and censored liberal democracies are prepared to go to great lengths to adjudicate on speech that could potentially promote racial or

objectionable content lyrics that are misogynist and blankly and uncritically violent have been condemned as unjust assaults on the right to free expression attacks on negative content in hip hop have been made all the more emotive because they appear to be an attempt to restrict the speech of members of vulnerable and marginalised communities side proposition agrees with mcwhorter that listening to music that contains violent themes will not in the absence of other factors cause individuals to behave in a violent way however the content of rap and its strong links with the youngest inhabitants of marginalised stigmatised urban areas mean that it damages the developmental opportunities of teenagers and young people and harms others perceptions of the communities they live in hip hop trades on its authenticity the extent to which it faithfully portrays the lived experience of the inhabitants of deprived inner city areas the greater the veracity of a hip hop track the greater its popularity and cache among fans musicians have gained public recognition as a result of being directly involved in street crime and gang activities 50 cent a high profile gansta artist owes his popularity in part to a shooting in 2000 that left him with 9 bullet wounds 3 this supposed link to reality is the most dangerous aspect of contemporary hip hop culture unlike the simplistic make believe of say action films the experiences related by rappers are also their public personas and become the rationale for their success rap through materialist boasting and sexualised music videos tells vulnerable young men and women from isolated neighbourhoods that their problems can be solved by adopting similarly nihilistic personas the poverty that affects many of the communities that hip hop artists identify with does more than separate individuals from economic opportunity it also confines the inhabitants of these communities geographically politically and culturally it prevents young men and women from becoming aware of perspectives on the world and society that run contrary to the violence of main stream rap with television dominated by the gangsta motif marginalised youngsters are left with little in the way of dissenting voices to convince them that hip hop takes a subjective and commercialised approach to the lives and communities that rappers claim to represent in effect controversial hip hop is capable of sponsoring violent behaviour when it is marketed as an accurate portrayal of relationships values and principles under these circumstances adolescents whose own identity is nascent and malleable can easily be misled into emulating the exploits and attitudes of rappers 4 side proposition advocates the control and classification of controversial forms of music including but not limited to hip hop consistent with principles 1 and 10 classification of this type will follow similar schemes applied to movies and videogames assessments of the content of music will be conducted by a politically independent organisation musicians and record companies will have the ability to appeal the decisions of this body crucially the ban on music containing violent lyrics will take the form of a categorisation scheme content will not be blocked from sale or censored instead as with the sale of pornographic material in many liberal democratic states music found to contain especially violent lyrics will be confined to closed off areas in shops to which only adults as defined in law will be admitted its performance on television radio and in cinemas will be banned live performances of restricted music will be obliged to enforce strict age monitoring policies online distributors of music will be compelled to comply with similar age restrictions and intentionally exposing minors to violent music will be punishable under child protection laws this approach has the advantage of limiting access to violent content only to consumers who are judged in general to be mature enough to understand that its message and the posturing of singers does not equate to permission to engage in deviant behaviour 1 mcwhorter j how hip

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro03a,defending hip hop artists right to free speech the intervention of the state is necessary in order to ensure that aggressive forms of hip hop remain accessible only to adults especially in neighbourhoods and home environments that are not part of a cohesive caring community some degree of public control over the content of hip hop will also help to preserve the diversity accessibility of the genre in the face of commercial dominance by violent forms of rap mainstream success in hip hop has become synonymous with gangsta rap and with artists who have backgrounds that lend veracity to their lurid verses however many of these supposedly authentic experiences consist of little more than exaggeration and invented personas when being interviewed about the controversial content of her son s single fuck tha police the mother of rapper ice cube commented that i don t see him saying those curse words i see him like an actor the existence of pornography attests to the market for forms of media that fulfil base and simplistic human fantasies much the same can be said for the violent and cynical content of rap singles unlike the relationship between cinema and pornography however many commentators appear to regard gangsta rap as being synonymous with hip hop a position as deceptive as a film critic claiming that all movies are inevitably tied to pornography the significant public profile and poor regulation of hip hop have meant that gangsta rap fans have become the genre s dominant class of consumer the amount of money that fans are willing to spend on singles albums concert tickets and associated branded goods means that labels that cultivate relationships with gangsta rappers have become the gatekeepers of the hip hop genre in general conscious rappers who do not glorify violence along with musicians working in other hip hop genres must work with labels that promote acts containing violent lyrics in order to publish their own music either consciously or by design the terrain of contemporary hip hop is hostile to musicians who are not prepared to discuss guns bitches and bling in their work this constitutes a significant barrier to rappers ability to communicate novel messages and listeners ability to receive them it could be called a market failure the pervasive public presence of gangsta rap has effectively denied an audience to other rappers classification has the potential to maximise the freedom and effectiveness of musical expression by hip hop artists who choose not to trade in brutality and misogyny the alternative is to allow hip hop to continue to be dominated by businesses such as death row records low life records and machete music this will lead to hip hop as a medium becoming inextricably linked with violent lyrics and the dubious businesses practices of gangsta labels bosses popular disengagement is much more likely under these circumstances and will actively deny a voice and

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con02a,a ban will be ineffective a new legal prohibition on any type of behaviour or conduct can only be set up by investing large amounts of political capital in order to transform vague proposals into a legislative document and then into a fully fledged law this expense can only be justified if the ban is effective if it is seen as a legitimate use of a state s power is enforceable and if it brings about some form of beneficial social change the change being sought in this instance is a reduction in the violence criminality and social disaffection that some people associate with hip hop music and its fans laws do not create changes in behaviour simply because they are laws it is unlikely that the consumers of hip hop will refrain from listening to it the ease with which music can be distributed and performed means that any ban on violent songs will inevitably be ineffective file sharing networks and cross border online stores such as ebay and silk road already enable people to obtain media and controlled goods with little more than a credit card and a forwarding address the total value of all of the music illegally pirated during 2007 is estimated to be 12 5 billion the same network of file sharing systems and data repositories would be used to distribute banned music if proposition s policies became law current urban music genres are

stations just as the internet contains a resilient ready made distribution network for music urban communities contain large numbers of ambitious talented amateur artists who will step into fill the

similar laws have been created to restrict access to violent videogames following widespread reports of the damaging effects that exposure to violent videogames might have on children australia banned outright the publication of a succession of violent and action oriented titles however in several instances implementation of this ban led only to increased piracy of prohibited games through file sharing networks and attempts by publishing companies to circumvent the ban using websites based in jurisdictions outside australia similar behaviour is likely to result in other liberal democracies following any ban on music with violent lyrics if banned controversial music will move from the managed regulated space occupied by record companies and distributors where business entities and artists agents can engage in structured transparent debate with classification bodies to the partly hidden and unregulated space of the internet as a consequence it will be much more difficult to

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con03a,a ban will further marginalise young members of impoverished communities hip hop is an extremely diverse musical genre surprisingly this diversity has evolved from highly minimal series of musical principles at its most basic raping consists of nothing more than rhyming verses that are delivered to a beat this simplicity reflects the economically marginalised communities that hip hop emerged from all that anyone requires in order to learn how to rap or to participate in hip hop culture is a pen some paper and possibly a disc of breaks the looped drum and bass lines that are used to time rap verses thanks to its highly social aspect hip hop continues to function as an accessible form of creative expression for members of some of impoverished communities in both the west and elsewhere in the world point 7 suggests that free speech flourishes when we respect believers but are not forced to respect their beliefs free speech debate discusses this principle in the light of religious belief and religious expression however it is also relevant when we consider how our appraisal of an individual s background culture and values affects our willingness to accept or dismiss what she says the positive case for banning or at least condemning hip hop often rests on its ability to reinforce the negative stereotypes of impoverished and marginalised communities that are propagated by majority communities critics of hip hop note that black men have often been stigmatised as violent uncivilised and predatory they claim that many hip hop artists cultivate a purposefully brutal and misogynist persona the popularity of hip hop reflects the acceptance of this stereotype and further entrenches discrimination against young black men this line of thinking portrays hip hop artists as betrayers or exploiters of their communities reinforcing damaging stereotypes and convincing adolescents that a violent rejection of mainstream society is a way to achieve material success arguments of this type fail to recognise the depth of nuance and meaning that words and word play can convey they are predicated on an assumption that the consumers of hip hop engage with it in a simplistic and uncritical way in short such arguments see hip hop fans as being simple minded and easily influenced this perspective neglects the recognition respect the recognition of equality and inherent dignity that is owed to all contributors of a debate moreover it also bars us from properly assessing the appraisal respect owed to the content of hip hop and other controversial musical genres when hip hop is seen as being inherently harmful and as being targeted at an especially impressionable and vulnerable part of society we both demean members of that group and prevent robust discussion of rap lyrics themselves academics such as john mcwhorter see only the advocacy of violence and nihilism in lyrics such as you grow in the ghetto living second rate and your eyes will sing a song of deep hate but these are words that can also be interpreted as astute observation on the brutality that is bred by social exclusion in point of fact there is little in the previous verse or those that follow it you ll admire all the numberbook takers thugs pimps and pushers and the big money makers that could be interpreted as permitting popularising or endorsing violence that is unless the individual reading the verse had already concluded that its intended audience lacked his own critical perspective and understanding of social norms and values even if an observer were ultimately conclude that a particular hip hop track had no redeeming value a broad interpretation of point 7 suggests that he should at the very least credit its artists and listeners with a modicum of intelligence and reflectiveness when we approach music with a custodial mind set determined to protect young listeners from what we see as harm or exploitation we prevent those individuals from access a form of speech that may be the only affordable method of expression open to them just as we allow individuals the right to be heard in a language of their choosing see point 1 we should also accept that perspectives from marginalised communities may not appear in a conventional form under these circumstances it would be dangerous for us to curtail and marginalise a form of speech geared toward discussing the problems faced by impoverished young people that has against the odds penetrated the mainstream we are likely

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con01a,violent imagery can serve different purposes calls for a ban on music that references or glorifies violence are frequently based on an overly simplistic understanding of contemporary and popular musical genres it is instructive that the loudest voices of protest raised against violent content in hip hop and rock music are overwhelmingly white middle class middle aged newspaper columnists any ban created under these circumstances would reduce the diversity and depth of popular musical genres by preventing musicians from commenting in any way on violent events banning particular musical tracks due only to the fact that they discuss violent acts would be damaging to the creative industries and would not reflect methods currently used to classify and restrict content appearing in other media criminal acts are punished when an act results in a damaging outcome and because that act is performed with a particular dishonest or malicious intention generally someone cannot be found guilty of murder if they did not intend to kill their victim similarly it is unusual for films or videogames to be censored or banned because they happen to depict violent acts the intention that underlies the use of graphic images or words must also be examined as bbc director general mark thompson noted when discussing the controversial religious content of jerry springer the opera with freespeechdebate com jerry springer i saw without feeling that it was offensive to me because the intention of the piece was so clearly a satire about an american talk show host and his world rather than the religious figures as such classification boards will look at the context in which an offensive act is shown the violence of war is portrayed vividly in saving private ryan but the film has not been banned on this basis private ryan portrays violence and suffering in order to remind us of the inhumanity that pervaded the second world war it uses violence to make a didactic point to move its audience to sympathy and disgust if a film were to use images of extreme violence or suffering as a form of entertainment inviting the audience to take pleasure in brutality a classification board would try to restrict or censor its content comparably violent music can use brutal language and themes to make moving and engaging observations about the world violent music does not automatically glorify violence nor does it cause its audience to see violence as something that is glamorous listened to out of context without any attempt to critically analyse the imagery of the song and the intentions of the artists it is easy to condemn many acclaimed examples of popular music as containing violent lyrics by giving into the populist pressure that is represented and generated by newspaper columnists and talk show hosts we risk creating a chilling effect not only on mainstream hip hop culture but on any other musical form that dares to discuss themes that fall outside narrowly and arbitrarily defined limits of social acceptability,violnt imagery an serve different urposs calls fr a ban on music that references or glorifies

test-international-gmehbisrip1b-pro01a,israel has no right to the occupied territories because israel won the land during war it is considered occupied territory under international law and it is illegal for israel to annex it 1 in july 2004 the international court of justice delivered an advisory opinion observing that under customary international law as reflected in article 42 of the regulations annexed to the hague iv convention territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised israel raised a number of exceptions and objections but the court found them unpersuasive the court ruled that territories had been occupied by the israeli armed forces in 1967 during the conflict between israel and jordan and that subsequent events in those territories had done nothing to alter the situation 2 even the israeli supreme court has ruled that judea and samaria a k a the west bank areas are held by the state of israel in belligerent occupation 3 therefore israel has no better claim to these lands than that it won them in a war which is an illegitimate claim under international law and also illegitimate as a thinly disguised morally abhorrent might makes right argument the fact that arab states initiated the 1967 war does not justify israel responding by annexing palestinian territory 4 a just settlement would have been a return to the previous borders in exchange for security guarantees etc instead israel unjustly used the opportunity to take land from an innocent people one bad act does not justify another bad act in return moreover it is notable that the nations which israel took gaza and the west bank from in 1967 egypt and jordan respectively were not representative nations of the areas majority inhabitants the palestinian people 5 it is thus illegitimate for israel to claim ownership of

test-international-gmehbisrip1b-con02a,returning to the 1967 borders would make war more likely the foreign minister of israel avigdor lieberman said in 2009 a return to the pre 1967 lines with a palestinian state in judea and samaria would bring the conflict into israel s borders establishing a palestinian state will not bring an end to the conflict 1 this is why the american ambassador to the un at the time of the 1967 war pointed out that israel s prior frontiers had proved to be notably insecure and american president lyndon johnson shortly after the war declared that israel s return to its former lines would be not a prescription for peace but for renewed hostilities johnson advocated new recognized boundaries that would provide security against terror destruction and war 2 an israel that withdrew completely to the 1967 borders would offer a very tempting target since it would be a narrow country with no strategic depth whose main population centres and strategic infrastructure would be within tactical range of forces deployed along the commanding heights of the west bank this would hurt israel s ability to deter future attacks and thus make conflict in the region even more likely this ability of israel to deter aggressors is particularly important not only due to the region s history of aggression against israel but also due to the unpredictable future events in the highly volatile middle east there is no way for example to guarantee that iraq will not evolve into a radical shi ite state that is dependent on iran and hostile to israel indeed king abdullah of jordan has warned of a hostile shi ite axis that could include iran iraq and syria nor that a jordan s palestinian majority might seize power in the state leaving israel to defend itself against a palestinian state that stretches from iraq to kalkilya nor that in the future militant islamic elements will not succeed in gaining control of the egyptian regime 3 given its narrow geographical dimensions a future attack launched from the pre 1967 borders against israel s nine mile wide waist could easily split the country in two especially seeing as islamic militants throughout the middle east are unlikely to be reconciled to israel even by a withdrawal to the 1967 borders such a withdrawal therefore would actually make peace in the region less likely and encourage war

test-international-gmehbisrip1b-con01a,israel has the right to claim minimal territory to ensure security israel has been the victim of multiple major illegal wars of aggression on the part of the arab world most notably in 1948 and 1967 these wars invalidate any special claim made by arabs and palestinians to pre 1967 territory and justify israel in keeping as much territory as is necessary to secure itself against these hostile states israel could have gone much further and taken more territory than it did in 1967 as it was easily winning the war but instead it restricted itself to only taking the territory that was necessary for it to create security buffer 1 when peace deals have allowed israel to improve its security through giving up land historically it has done so for example when it returned the sinai peninsula to egypt in 1982 in exchange for a peace treaty with egypt or when israel returned the small swath of jordanian territory it held when king hussain of jordan wanted to make peace to date israel has withdrawn from approximately 93 percent of the territories it captured in return for peace with syria and an end to palestinian terror it is prepared to withdraw from most of the remaining 7 in dispute although not all israel remains committed to trading land for peace and never annexed the west bank or gaza strip because it expected to return part of these territories in negotiations when the palestinians finally declared that they would recognize israel and renounce terrorism israel agreed to begin to withdraw since 1993 israel has turned over approximately 80 of the gaza strip and more than 40 of the west bank to the palestinian authority thus israel s objection is not so much against returning any of the land captured in 1967 but against returning absolutely all of it and going back completely to the 1967 borders as this would mean giving up territories vital for israel s security the minimal slivers of territory that israel it seeks to maintain through a peace settlement after returning 90 of the pre 1967 territory is very important to its national security as it offers a buffer against future arab wars of aggression this why ehud olmert stressed that only most of the occupied territory could be returned he still argued that some had to be kept for security reasons we can never totally return to the indefensible pre 1967 borders we simply cannot afford to make israel 9 miles wide again at its center we can t allow the palestinians to be a couple miles from tel aviv s ben gurion airport in the age of shoulder fire missiles with the capacity to shoot down jumbo jets 2 moreover israel is in an anomalous situation it is an embattled democracy that historically has had to defend itself repeatedly against the armies of neighbouring arab states whose declared goal was nothing less than israel s eradication the israel defense forces could not afford to miscalculate while other nations like france or kuwait have been overrun occupied and nonetheless have survived to reconstitute themselves israel in contrast cannot depend on obtaining a second chance miscalculation on its part could have had devastating consequences and thus its situation is unique 3 for this critical purpose of national survival therefore the annexed land serves a legally legitimate purpose especially considering that the arab wars of aggression were what caused the annexation of the land in the first place in such circumstances a nation that won a defensive war has a right to set terms to ensure against future wars of

ussr it was not considered part of the same region that is now georgia and thus during its years under the ussr s ossetia built up a significant degree of autonomy and independence in its internal functioning therefore georgia s only real claim to south ossetia must extend back nearly a century before the time of the soviet union this significantly weakens georgia s claim over south ossetia but moreover georgia s historical claim on south ossetia is quite weak even in isolation this is because s ossetia has its own distinct language and history to that of georgia ossetian or ossetic is a member of the northeastern iranian branch of indo european languages about 500 000 people speak ossetian in ossetia 3 4 that ossetia has this distinct language is an important fact in favour of its status as a nation state and in favor of its independence georgia however has been accused of committing genocide against the south ossetians in 1920 1993 and 2008 with tens of thousands of s ossetians dying over the course of these conflicts 5 the georgian government has also attempted to suppress s ossetian culture and identity for example banning the use of the ossetian language in official documents and abolishing s ossetian autonomy within georgia 6 georgian rule in s ossetia is therefore both ahistorical due to s ossetia s long and recognised history of independence and

s nuclear proliferation on nov 19 2010 the anti defamation league released a statement which came from robert g sugarman adl national chair and abraham h foxman adl national director the severe damage that could be inflicted on that relationship by failing to ratify the treaty would inevitably hamper effective american international leadership to stop the iranian nuclear weapons program the iranian nuclear threat is the most serious national security issue facing the united states israel and other allies in the middle east while some senators may have legitimate reservations about the new start treaty or its protocol we believe the interest of our greater and common goal of preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons must take precedence 1 new start is crucial in getting russian support against iran and other rogue nuclear states although the united states needs a strong and reliable nuclear force the chief nuclear danger today comes not from russia but from rogue states such as iran and north korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists given those pressing dangers some question why an arms control treaty with russia matters it matters because it is in both parties interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship it also matters because russia s cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the iranian and north korean programs russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure loose nukes in russia and elsewhere and russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in afghanistan a breeding ground for international terrorism obviously the united states does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends any treaty must be considered on its merits but the new start agreement is clearly in the us national interest and the ramifications of not ratifying it could be significantly negative 2 as us vice president joe biden argued in 2010 new start is also a cornerstone of our efforts to reset relations with russia which have improved significantly in the last two years this has led to real benefits for u s and global security russian cooperation made it possible to secure strong sanctions against iran over its nuclear ambitions and russia canceled a sale to iran of an advanced anti aircraft missile system that would have been dangerously destabilizing russia has permitted the flow of materiel through its territory for our troops in afghanistan and as the nato russia council in lisbon demonstrated european security has been advanced by the pursuit of a more cooperative relationship with russia we should not jeopardize this progress 3 therefore because new start will have significant positive consequences in terms of

the table is a nuclear arms reduction and verification treaty between the united states and russia the treaty called new start would reduce russian and american deployed nuclear weapons to 1 550 and delivery vehicles to 700 each this would be a 33 percent reduction in the existing arsenals which is worth achieving and celebrating even as we know that countless cities and millions of precious human beings could be destroyed by the use of even part of the remaining arsenals still these reductions would be a great step on the way to a safer world as would the re establishment of bilateral intrusive verification measures for both sides also part of the treaty 1 the world is simply a much less secure place without new start and not just because new start means there are physically fewer nuclear weapons and thus a lesser chance of nuclear disasters although this in itself is compelling rather new start also has immense symbolic value in demonstrating that the two greatest powers have enough in common and are interested enough in their mutual security that they can agree to deduce nuclear weapons together it shows that these nations regard each other as partners for world peace not as enemies the alternative world without new start would be one in which the mutual suspicion and animosity of the cold war might continue it is notable that prime minister vladimir putin said in an interview released in early december 2010 that russia might be forced to build up its nuclear forces against the west if the united states fails to ratify the new start treaty 2 the threat of russia or even the us resuming nuclear build ups is a frightening thought for both nations for the world and for peace on top of its other benefits new start is key to opening russian nuclear weapons up for verification which contributes to trust and peace as former secretaries of state kissinger shultz eagleburger baker and powell argue the agreement emphasizes verification providing a valuable window into russia s nuclear arsenal since the original start expired last december russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes in its strategic nuclear arsenal and the united states has been unable to conduct on site inspections each day america s understanding of russia s arsenal has been degraded and resources have been diverted from national security tasks to try to fill the gaps our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into russia s activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent mission 3

test-international-glilpdwhsn-pro03a,the new start treaty maintains us nuclear and missile defence the us nuclear armament will be modernized along with new start the obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process the administration has put forth a 10 year plan to spend 84 billion on the energy department s nuclear weapons complex much of the credit for getting the administration to add 14 billion to the originally proposed 70 billion for modernization goes to sen jon kyl the arizona republican who has been vigilant in this effort implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond 1 both us military and civilian leaders insist that the new start treaty will still allow the us to deploy effective missile defenses something which russia was opposed to and so will not affect us missile defense plans the main limit on missile defense is that the treaty prevents the conversion of existing launchers for this purpose this would be more expensive than building new missiles specifically for defense purposes 2 furthermore as joe biden argues new start is important to russian cooperation on missile defense this missile defense system demonstrates america s enduring commitment to article 5 of the washington treaty that an attack on one is an attack on all nato missile defense also provides the opportunity for further improvements in both nato russian and u s russian relations nato and russia agreed at lisbon to carry out a joint ballistic missile threat assessment to resume theater missile defense exercises and to explore further cooperation on territorial missile defense things that were nearly unimaginable two years ago these agreements underscore the strategic importance the alliance attaches to improving its relationship with russia but trust and confidence in our relationship with russia would be undermined without senate approval of the new start treaty which reduces strategic nuclear forces to levels not seen since the 1950s and restores important verification mechanisms that ceased when the first start treaty expired last december 3 in many ways in the 21st century having an abundance of nuclear weapons particularly having too many is more of a liability than an advantage the united states will be far safer with fewer nuclear weapons in the world and a stronger more stable relationship with russia under new start and this is desirable therefore it is clear that new start maintains the important parts of us nuclear capabilities while removing the over abundance which may become a liability due to security and medical concerns and so new start should be supported 1 kissinger henry a shultz george p baker iii

test-international-glilpdwhsn-con02a,the new start treaty helps russia more than the us not only does new start leave in place russia s extant tactical nuclear advantage but it has further loopholes for russian weapons as mitt romney argued in 2010 does the treaty provide gaping loopholes that russia could use to escape nuclear weapon limits entirely yes for example multiple warhead missile bombers are counted under the treaty as only one warhead while we currently have more bombers than the russians they have embarked on new programs for long range bombers and for air launched nuclear cruise missiles thus it is no surprise that russia is happy to undercount missiles on bombers 1 new start also fails to limit rail mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms which russia could potentially make use of the definition of rail mobile icbm launchers was established in the expired start as an erector launcher mechanism for launching icbms and the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted 2 this and associated restrictions and limitations in start are not in the new start this makes it possible for russia to claim that any new rail mobile icbms are not subject to new start limitations 3 mitt romney worries that russia is already working to take advantage of these omissions as drafted it lets russia escape the limit on its number of strategic nuclear warheads loopholes and lapses presumably carefully crafted by moscow provide a path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead reduction targets these omissions would be consistent with russia s plans for a new heavy bomber and reports of growing interest in rail mobile icbms 4 this means that under the treaty limits the united states is the only country that must reduce its launchers and strategic nuclear weapons russia has managed to negotiate the treaty limits so that they simply restrict it to reductions it was already planning to do as a result the united states is making what are effectively unilateral reductions 5 therefore new start is an unequal treaty as it offers more to russia than to the us this is bad for the balance of power and thus bad for world peace and so new start should be opposed 1

test-international-glilpdwhsn-con03a,the new start treaty sets a bad approach for a changing world new start reduces us deterrence in world that is arming not disarming the united states has relied on deterrence for sixty years and as a result has prevented war between the great powers a us drawdown especially as other new powers are arming will undermine deterrence this will then encourage rivals to try to catch the united states while the reductions show that the united states is in decline 1 while proponents of reducing nuclear weapons or reaching global zero argue that possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states is the incentive behind proliferation this is not true the us has consistently taken leadership in the reduction of nuclear arms through treaties but this has so far had no effect in encouraging other nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals and indeed new powers have joined the club reducing nuclear arms through new start will therefore not encourage others to stop pursuing nukes the u s should not be taking steps towards disarmament without all nuclear weapons states including those not signed up to the nuclear non proliferation treaty also being involved 2 new start also fails to speak to the issue of protecting and defending the u s and its allies against strategic attack the treaty fails to recognize that deterrence is no longer simply between the u s and russia and that the whole policy should no longer be based on just against strategic attacks on the united states or very close allies instead it is much more critical to deal with nuclear policy towards rogue states and rising powers 3 finally the us should not set a precedent that it will sacrifice its own interests to bribe russia over issues like iran as the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa argues we are told that the real purpose of new start is to create a stronger u s russia bond in a broader international effort to restrain iran s nuclear weapons program such a justification is wrong iran s nuclear ambitions are no secret neither are russia s past efforts in aiding that program we seriously question whether russia is serious about stopping iran with or without new start there is no reason why the united states should be required to sacrifice its own defense capabilities to inspire russia to a greater degree of diplomatic fortitude if russia is indeed concerned with a nuclear armed iran to its immediate south it should need no extra incentive to take the action necessary to stop it 4 if the u s bribes russia over iran china might

test-international-glilpdwhsn-con01a,the new start treaty harms us nuclear capabilities as david ganz the president of the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa argues this treaty would restrain the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons missile defense systems and missile delivery systems 1 the atrophying u s nuclear arsenal and weapons enterprise make reductions in the u s strategic nuclear arsenal even more dangerous the new start treaty allows nuclear modernization but while the us capacity to modernize nuclear weapons is limited and either congress or the president is likely to prevent modernization on cost grounds the russians have a large if unknown advantage over the united states in terms of nonstrategic particularly tactical and nuclear weapons the new start treaty however ignores these weapons entirely as it is focused on strategic arms this therefore leaves the russians with an advantage and potentially reduces the potential for deterrence in areas beyond the us 2 new start also restricts us missile defence options the obama administration insists the treaty doesn t affect it but the kremlin s takes a different view start can operate and be viable only if the united states of america refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively 3 new start imposes restrictions on u s missile defence options in at least four areas first the preamble recognizes the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms it seeks to make sure defensive arms do not undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the parties so defensive arms must be reduced to allow offensive arms to remain effective 4 russia also issued a unilateral statement on april 7 2010 russia reinforced this restriction by issuing a unilateral statement asserting that it considers the extraordinary events that give the right to withdraw from this treaty to include a buildup of missile defense 5 second article v states each party shall not convert and shall not use icbm launchers and slbm launchers for placement of missile defense interceptors and vice versa 6 there are also restrictions on some types of missiles and launchers that are used in the testing of missile defense and finally article x established the bilateral consultative commission bcc the

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-pro02a,the new start treaty will help against iran s nuclear program new start will help bolster us russian cooperation which is necessary for solving the problem of iran s nuclear proliferation on nov 19 2010 the anti defamation league released a statement which came from robert g sugarman adl national chair and abraham h foxman adl national director the severe damage that could be inflicted on that relationship by failing to ratify the treaty would inevitably hamper effective american international leadership to stop the iranian nuclear weapons program the iranian nuclear threat is the most serious national security issue facing the united states israel and other allies in the middle east while some senators may have legitimate reservations about the new start treaty or its protocol we believe the interest of our greater and common goal of preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons must take precedence 1 new start is crucial in getting russian support against iran and other rogue nuclear states although the united states needs a strong and reliable nuclear force the chief nuclear danger today comes not from russia but from rogue states such as iran and north korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists given those pressing dangers some question why an arms control treaty with russia matters it matters because it is in both parties interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship it also matters because russia s cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the iranian and north korean programs russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure loose nukes in russia and elsewhere and russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in afghanistan a breeding ground for international terrorism obviously the united states does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends any treaty must be considered on its

start is also a cornerstone of our efforts to reset relations with russia which have improved significantly in the last two years this has led to real benefits for u s and global security russian cooperation made it possible to secure strong sanctions against iran over its nuclear ambitions and russia canceled a sale to iran of an advanced anti aircraft missile system that would have been dangerously destabilizing russia has permitted the flow of materiel through its territory for our troops in afghanistan and as the nato russia council in lisbon demonstrated european security has been advanced by the pursuit of a more cooperative relationship with russia we should not jeopardize this progress 3 therefore because new start will have significant positive consequences in terms of

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-pro01a,the new start treaty will make for a safer world reducing us and russian nuclear weapons stockpiles makes for a safer world as dr david gushee states the issue on the table is a nuclear arms reduction and verification treaty between the united states and russia the treaty called new start would reduce russian and american deployed nuclear weapons to 1 550 and delivery vehicles to 700 each this would be a 33 percent reduction in the existing arsenals which is worth achieving and celebrating even as we know that countless cities and millions of precious human beings could be destroyed by the use of even part of the remaining arsenals still these reductions would be a great step on the way to a safer world as would the re establishment of bilateral intrusive verification measures for both sides also part of the treaty 1 the world is simply a much less secure place without new start and not just because new start means there are physically fewer nuclear weapons and thus a lesser chance of nuclear disasters although this in itself is compelling rather new start also has immense symbolic value in demonstrating that the two greatest powers have enough in common and are interested enough in their mutual security that they can agree to deduce nuclear weapons together it shows that these nations regard each other as partners for world peace not as enemies the alternative world without new start would be one in which the mutual suspicion and animosity of the cold war might continue it is notable that prime minister vladimir putin said in an interview released in early december 2010 that russia might be forced to build up its nuclear forces against the west if the united states fails to ratify the new start treaty 2 the threat of russia or even the us resuming nuclear build ups is a frightening thought for both nations for the world and for peace on top of its other benefits new start is key to opening russian nuclear weapons up for verification which contributes to trust and peace as former secretaries of state kissinger shultz eagleburger baker and powell argue the agreement emphasizes verification providing a valuable window into russia s nuclear arsenal since the original start expired last december russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes in its strategic nuclear arsenal and the united states has been unable to conduct on site inspections each day america s understanding of russia s arsenal has been degraded and resources have been diverted from national security tasks to try to fill the gaps our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into russia s activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent mission 3

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-pro03a,the new start treaty maintains us nuclear and missile defence the us nuclear armament will be modernized along with new start the obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process the administration has put forth a 10 year plan to spend 84 billion on the energy department s nuclear weapons complex much of the credit for getting the administration to add 14 billion to the originally proposed 70 billion for modernization goes to sen jon kyl the arizona republican who has been vigilant in this effort implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond 1 both us military and civilian leaders insist that the new start treaty will still allow the us to deploy effective missile defenses something which russia was opposed to and so will not affect us missile defense plans the main limit on missile defense is that the treaty prevents the conversion of existing launchers for this purpose this would be more expensive than building new missiles specifically for defense purposes 2 furthermore as joe biden argues new start is important to russian cooperation on missile defense this missile defense system demonstrates america s enduring commitment to article 5 of the washington treaty that an attack on one is an attack on all nato missile defense also provides the opportunity for further improvements in both nato russian and u s russian relations nato and russia agreed at lisbon to carry out a joint ballistic missile threat assessment to resume theater missile defense exercises and to explore further cooperation on territorial missile defense things that were nearly unimaginable two years ago these agreements underscore the strategic importance the alliance attaches to improving its relationship with russia but trust and confidence in our relationship with russia would be undermined without senate approval of the new start treaty which reduces strategic nuclear forces to levels not seen since the 1950s and restores important verification mechanisms that ceased when the first start treaty expired last december 3 in many ways in the 21st century having an abundance of nuclear weapons particularly having too many is more of a liability than an advantage the united states will be far safer with fewer nuclear weapons in the world and a stronger more stable relationship with russia under new start and this is desirable therefore it is clear that new start maintains the important parts of us nuclear capabilities while removing the over abundance which may become a liability due to security and medical concerns and so new start should be supported 1 kissinger henry a shultz george p baker iii

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-con02a,the new start treaty helps russia more than the us not only does new start leave in place russia s extant tactical nuclear advantage but it has further loopholes for russian weapons as mitt romney argued in 2010 does the treaty provide gaping loopholes that russia could use to escape nuclear weapon limits entirely yes for example multiple warhead missile bombers are counted under the treaty as only one warhead while we currently have more bombers than the russians they have embarked on new programs for long range bombers and for air launched nuclear cruise missiles thus it is no surprise that russia is happy to undercount missiles on bombers 1 new start also fails to limit rail mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms which russia could potentially make use of the definition of rail mobile icbm launchers was established in the expired start as an erector launcher mechanism for launching icbms and the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted 2 this and associated restrictions and limitations in start are not in the new start this makes it possible for russia to claim that any new rail mobile icbms are not subject to new start limitations 3 mitt romney worries that russia is already working to take advantage of these omissions as drafted it lets russia escape the limit on its number of strategic nuclear warheads loopholes and lapses presumably carefully crafted by moscow provide a path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead reduction targets these omissions would be consistent with russia s plans for a new heavy bomber and reports of growing interest in rail mobile icbms 4 this means that under the treaty limits the united states is the only country that must reduce its launchers and strategic nuclear weapons russia has managed to negotiate the treaty limits so that they simply restrict it to reductions it was already planning to do as a result the united states is making what are effectively unilateral reductions 5 therefore new start is an unequal treaty as it offers more to russia than to the us this is bad for the balance of power and thus bad for world peace and so new start should be opposed 1

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-con03a,the new start treaty sets a bad approach for a changing world new start reduces us deterrence in world that is arming not disarming the united states has relied on deterrence for sixty years and as a result has prevented war between the great powers a us drawdown especially as other new powers are arming will undermine deterrence this will then encourage rivals to try to catch the united states while the reductions show that the united states is in decline 1 while proponents of reducing nuclear weapons or reaching global zero argue that possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states is the incentive behind proliferation this is not true the us has consistently taken leadership in the reduction of nuclear arms through treaties but this has so far had no effect in encouraging other nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals and indeed new powers have joined the club reducing nuclear arms through new start will therefore not encourage others to stop pursuing nukes the u s should not be taking steps towards disarmament without all nuclear weapons states including those not signed up to the nuclear non proliferation treaty also being involved 2 new start also fails to speak to the issue of protecting and defending the u s and its allies against strategic attack the treaty fails to recognize that deterrence is no longer simply between the u s and russia and that the whole policy should no longer be based on just against strategic attacks on the united states or very close allies instead it is much more critical to deal with nuclear policy towards rogue states and rising powers 3 finally the us should not set a precedent that it will sacrifice its own interests to bribe russia over issues like iran as the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa argues we are told that the real purpose of new start is to create a stronger u s russia bond in a broader international effort to restrain iran s nuclear weapons program such a justification is wrong iran s nuclear ambitions are no secret neither are russia s past efforts in aiding that program we seriously question whether russia is serious about stopping iran with or without new start there is no reason why the united states should be required to sacrifice its own defense capabilities to inspire russia to a greater degree of diplomatic fortitude if russia is indeed concerned with a nuclear armed iran to its immediate south it should need no extra incentive to take the action necessary to stop it 4 if the u s bribes russia over iran china might

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-con01a,the new start treaty harms us nuclear capabilities as david ganz the president of the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa argues this treaty would restrain the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons missile defense systems and missile delivery systems 1 the atrophying u s nuclear arsenal and weapons enterprise make reductions in the u s strategic nuclear arsenal even more dangerous the new start treaty allows nuclear modernization but while the us capacity to modernize nuclear weapons is limited and either congress or the president is likely to prevent modernization on cost grounds the russians have a large if unknown advantage over the united states in terms of nonstrategic particularly tactical and nuclear weapons the new start treaty however ignores these weapons entirely as it is focused on strategic arms this therefore leaves the russians with an advantage and potentially reduces the potential for deterrence in areas beyond the us 2 new start also restricts us missile defence options the obama administration insists the treaty doesn t affect it but the kremlin s takes a different view start can operate and be viable only if the united states of america refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively 3 new start imposes restrictions on u s missile defence options in at least four areas first the preamble recognizes the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms it seeks to make sure defensive arms do not undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the parties so defensive arms must be reduced to allow offensive arms to remain effective 4 russia also issued a unilateral statement on april 7 2010 russia reinforced this restriction by issuing a unilateral statement asserting that it considers the extraordinary events that give the right to withdraw from this treaty to include a buildup of missile defense 5 second article v states each party shall not convert and shall not use icbm launchers and slbm launchers for placement of missile defense interceptors and vice versa 6 there are also restrictions on some types of missiles and launchers that are used in the testing of missile defense and finally article x established the bilateral consultative commission bcc the

test-culture-tlhrilsfhwr-pro02a,the failure of rule of law as the anthropologist and lawyer sally falk moore observed law is only ever a piecemeal intervention by the state in the life of society i laws are ultimately social norms that are taught enforced and arbitrated on by the state the value of these norms is such that they are deemed to be a vital part of a society s identity and the state is entrusted with their protection however this ideal can be difficult to achieve debate as to which norms the state should be custodian of is constant where there is a disconnect between a law and the daily lives aspirations and struggles of a society it becomes unlikely that that law will be complied with generally a state will not be able to give a pronouncement the force of law if it does not reflect the values held by a majority of a society compliance with the law can be even harder to obtain in highly plural societies even in plural societies ruled peacefully by an effective central government such as india communities conceptions of children s rights may be radically different from those set down in law the indian child marriage restraint act has been in force since 1929 but the practice remains endemic in southern india to this day ii governments can attempt to enforce compliance with a law through education incentives or deterrence what if the state that is intended to mount the piecemeal intervention of banning the use of child soldiers is weak corrupt or non existent what if a state cannot carry out structured interventions of the type described above norms that state that the conscription of children is acceptable due to tradition or need will be dominant situations of this type will be the rule rather than the exception in underdeveloped states and states where conflict is so rife that children have become participants in warfare the icc has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals with command over military units who use children as combatants iii but how should the concept of a commander be defined in these circumstances in order for the juristic principles underlying the authority of the icc to function properly it is necessary for there to be a degree of certainty and accessibility underlying laws promulgated by a state while ignorance of the law is not a defence before the icc it impossible to call a system of law fair or just that is not overseen by a stable or accepted government this is not possible if a state is so corrupt that it does not command the trust of its people if a state is so poor that it cannot afford to operate an open reliable and transparent court and advocacy system if territory with a state s borders is occupied by an armed aggressor western notions of rule of law are almost impossible to enforce under such conditions all of these are scenarios encountered frequently in africa and central and southern asia some regions within developing nations are so isolated from the influence of the state or so heavily contested in internecine conflicts that communities living within them cannot be expected to know that the state nominally responsible for them has signed the convention of the rights of the child or the rome statute nor can the state attempt to inform them of this fact laws still exist and are enforced within such communities but these are not state made forms of law for an individual

psychological care this is now an accepted part of the practice of post conflict reconstruction referred to as disarmament demobilisation and reintegration ddr i the effects of chronic war and chronic engagement with war are best addressed by a slow and continuous process of habituation to normal life former child soldiers are sent to treatment centres specialising in this type of care in states such as sierra leone ii what is harmful to this process of recovery is the branding of child soldiers as war criminals the stigma attached to such a conviction would condemn hundreds of former child soldiers to suffering extended beyond the end of armed conflicts sentencing guidelines binding on the icc state that anyone convicted of war crimes who is younger than eighteen should not be subject to a sentence of life imprisonment their treatment once incarcerated is required to be oriented toward rehabilitation many child soldiers become officers within the organisations that they join alternately they might find themselves ordered to seek more recruits from their villages and communities for these children participation in the conflict becomes participation in the crime itself what began as a choice of necessity during war time could under the status quo damage and stigmatise a child during peace time iii even if their sentence emphasises reform and education a former child soldier is likely to become an uninjured casualty of the war marked out as complicit in acts of aggression when labelled as such children will become vulnerable to reprisal attacks and entrenched social exclusion discussing attempts to foster former colombian child combatants the coalition to stop the use of child soldiers state that the stigmatization of child soldiers frequently perceived as violent and threatening meant that families were reluctant to receive former child soldiers those leaving the specialized care centres moved either to youth homes or youth protection facilities for those with special protection problems while efforts continued to strengthen fostering and family based care approximately 60 per cent of those entering the ddr program were in institutional care in 2007 iv crucially fear of being targeted by the icc may lead former child soldiers to avoid disclosing their status to officials running demobilisation programs they may be deterred from participating in the ddr process v moreover the authority of the icc is often subject to criticism on the international stage by politicians and jurists linked to both democratic states vi and the non liberal or

justice if it is seen to target children often barely in their teens in the course of prosecuting war crimes as the child soliders 2008 global report notes prosecutions should not by focusing solely

test-culture-tlhrilsfhwr-pro04a,the cultural construction of armed conflict the jurisdiction of the icc is primarily exercised according to culturally constructed assumptions about the way war works that there will be a clear division between aggressors and defenders that armies will be organised according to chains of command the civilians will not be targeted and will be evacuated from conflict zones but countless conflicts in africa and central asia have proven these assumptions to be flawed it should not be forgotten that almost all formulations of this motion define cultural relativism only as a defence to the use of child soldiers it will still be open for icc prosecutors to prove that the use of child soldiers has been systematic pernicious and deliberate rather than the product of uncertainty necessity and unstable legal norms moreover not all defences are complete defences they do not all result in acquittal and are often used by judges to mitigate the harshness of certain sentences it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances at the very least those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy due to the nature of conflicts in developing nations where the geographic influence of recognised governments is limited and multiple local law making bodies may contribute to an armed struggle it is difficult for the international community to directly oversee combat itself united nations troops are often underfunded unmotivated and poorly trained being sourced primarily from the same continent as the belligerent parties in a conflict when peacekeepers are deployed from western nations their rules of engagement have previously prevented robust protection of civilian populations ironically this is partly the result of concerns that western states might be accused of indulging in neo colonialism it is outrageous for the international community to dictate standards of war time conduct to communities and states unable to enforce them while withholding the assistance and expertise that might allow them to do so therefore the icc as a specialist legal and investigative body should be encouraged to use the expertise it has accumulated to distinguish between child military participation driven by a desire to terrorise populations or quickly reinforce

test-society-tlhrilsfhwr-pro02a,the failure of rule of law as the anthropologist and lawyer sally falk moore observed law is only ever a piecemeal intervention by the state in the life of society i laws are ultimately social norms that are taught enforced and arbitrated on by the state the value of these norms is such that they are deemed to be a vital part of a society s identity and the state is entrusted with their protection however this ideal can be difficult to achieve debate as to which norms the state should be custodian of is constant where there is a disconnect between a law and the daily lives aspirations and struggles of a society it becomes unlikely that that law will be complied with generally a state will not be able to give a pronouncement the force of law if it does not reflect the values held by a majority of a society compliance with the law can be even harder to obtain in highly plural societies even in plural societies ruled peacefully by an effective central government such as india communities conceptions of children s rights may be radically different from those set down in law the indian child marriage restraint act has been in force since 1929 but the practice remains endemic in southern india to this day ii governments can attempt to enforce compliance with a law through education incentives or deterrence what if the state that is intended to mount the piecemeal intervention of banning the use of child soldiers is weak corrupt or non existent what if a state cannot carry out structured interventions of the type described above norms that state that the conscription of children is acceptable due to tradition or need will be dominant situations of this type will be the rule rather than the exception in underdeveloped states and states where conflict is so rife that children have become participants in warfare the icc has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals with command over military units who use children as combatants iii but how should the concept of a commander be defined in these circumstances in order for the juristic principles underlying the authority of the icc to function properly it is necessary for there to be a degree of certainty and accessibility underlying laws promulgated by a state while ignorance of the law is not a defence before the icc it impossible to call a system of law fair or just that is not overseen by a stable or accepted government this is not possible if a state is so corrupt that it does not command the trust of its people if a state is so poor that it cannot afford to operate an open reliable and transparent court and advocacy system if territory with a state s borders is occupied by an armed aggressor western notions of rule of law are almost impossible to enforce under such conditions all of these are scenarios encountered frequently in africa and central and southern asia some regions within developing nations are so isolated from the influence of the state or so heavily contested in internecine conflicts that communities living within them cannot be expected to know that the state nominally responsible for them has signed the convention of the rights of the child or the rome statute nor can the state attempt to inform them of this fact laws still exist and are enforced within such communities but these are not state made forms of law for an individual

test-society-tlhrilsfhwr-pro03a,removing barriers to demobilisation disarmament and rehabilitation it can easily be conceded without weakening the resolution that war and combat are horrific damaging experiences over the last seventy years the international community has attempted to limit the suffering that follows the end of a conflict by giving soldiers and civilians access to medical and psychological care this is now an accepted part of the practice of post conflict reconstruction referred to as disarmament demobilisation and reintegration ddr i the effects of chronic war and chronic engagement with war are best addressed by a slow and continuous process of habituation to normal life former child soldiers are sent to treatment centres specialising in this type of care in states such as sierra leone ii what is harmful to this process of recovery is the branding of child soldiers as war criminals the stigma attached to such a conviction would condemn hundreds of former child soldiers to suffering extended beyond the end of armed conflicts sentencing guidelines binding on the icc state that anyone convicted of war crimes who is younger than eighteen should not be subject to a sentence of life imprisonment their treatment once incarcerated is required to be oriented toward rehabilitation many child soldiers become officers within the organisations that they join alternately they might find themselves ordered to seek more recruits from their villages and communities for these children participation in the conflict becomes participation in the crime itself what began as a choice of necessity during war time could under the status quo damage and stigmatise a child during peace time iii even if their sentence emphasises reform and education a former child soldier is likely to become an uninjured casualty of the war marked out as complicit in acts of aggression when labelled as such children will become vulnerable to reprisal attacks and entrenched social exclusion discussing attempts to foster former colombian child combatants the coalition to stop the use of child soldiers state that the stigmatization of child soldiers frequently perceived as violent and threatening meant that families were reluctant to receive former child soldiers those leaving the specialized care centres moved either to youth homes or youth protection facilities for those with special protection problems while efforts continued to strengthen fostering and family based care approximately 60 per cent of those entering the ddr program were in institutional care in 2007 iv crucially fear of being targeted by the icc may lead former child soldiers to avoid disclosing their status to officials running demobilisation programs they may be deterred from participating in the ddr process v moreover the authority of the icc is often subject to criticism on the international stage by politicians and jurists linked to both democratic states vi and the non liberal or authoritarian regimes most likely to become involved in conflicts that breach humanitarian law it cannot assist the claims of the icc to be a body that represents universal concepts of compassion and justice if it is seen to target children often barely in their teens in the course of prosecuting war crimes as the child soliders 2008 global report notes prosecutions should not by focusing solely on the recruitment and use of child soldiers exclude other crimes committed against children such an approach risks stigmatizing child soldiers and ignores the wider abuses experienced by children in conflict situations it is on these grounds that some have questioned the exclusive child soldier focus of the icc s charges against thomas lubanga after all the union of congolese patriots upc l the

test-society-tlhrilsfhwr-pro04a,the cultural construction of armed conflict the jurisdiction of the icc is primarily exercised according to culturally constructed assumptions about the way war works that there will be a clear division between aggressors and defenders that armies will be organised according to chains of command the civilians will not be targeted and will be evacuated from conflict zones but countless conflicts in africa and central asia have proven these assumptions to be flawed it should not be forgotten that almost all formulations of this motion define cultural relativism only as a defence to the use of child soldiers it will still be open for icc prosecutors to prove that the use of child soldiers has been systematic pernicious and deliberate rather than the product of uncertainty necessity and unstable legal norms moreover not all defences are complete defences they do not all result in acquittal and are often used by judges to mitigate the harshness of certain sentences it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances at the very least those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy due to the nature of conflicts in developing nations where the geographic influence of recognised governments is limited and multiple local law making bodies may contribute to an armed struggle it is difficult for the international community to directly oversee combat itself united nations troops are often underfunded unmotivated and poorly trained being sourced primarily from the same continent as the belligerent parties in a conflict when peacekeepers are deployed from western nations their rules of engagement have previously prevented robust protection of civilian populations ironically this is partly the result of concerns that western states might be accused of indulging in neo colonialism it is outrageous for the international community to dictate standards of war time conduct to communities and states unable to enforce them while withholding the assistance and expertise that might allow them to do so therefore the icc as a specialist legal and investigative body should be encouraged to use the expertise it has accumulated to distinguish between child military participation driven by a desire to terrorise populations or quickly reinforce

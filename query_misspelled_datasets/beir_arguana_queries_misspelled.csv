people and firms put the effort into developing and creating them the incentive to profit drives a great deal of people s intellectual endeavors research and development for example forms a major part of industries investment as they seek to create new products and inventions that will benefit consumers and thus society as a whole research and development is extremely costly however the us pharmaceutical industry alone spends tens of billions of dollars every year on researching new drugs1 the fear of theft or of lack of profit stemming from such research will serve as a powerful disincentive to investment without the protection of patents new drugs lose much of their value since a second comer on the field can simply take the formula and develop the same product without the

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro02a,hate speech the enforcement of the laws proposed in this article will be fraught complex and difficult however the difficulty of administering a law is never a good argument for refusing to enforce it the censorship of the written word ended in england with the lady chatterley and oz obscenity trials but this liberalisation of publication standards has not prevented the state from prosecuting hate speech when it appears in print it is clear that although we have more latitude than ever to say or write what we want no matter how objectionable standards and taboos continue to exist we can take it that these taboos are especially important and valuable to the running of a stable society as they have persisted despite the legal and cultural changes that have taken place over the last fifty years hate speech is prosecuted and censored because of its power to intrude into the lives of individuals who have not consented to receive it as pointed out in jeremy waldron s response 1 to timothy garton ash s piece 2 on hate speech hateful comments are not dangerous because they insight gullible individuals to abandon their inhibitions and engage in race riots hate speech is harmful because it recreates cheaply and in front of a very large audience an atmosphere in which vulnerable minorities are put in fear of becoming the targets of violence and prejudice additionally hate speech harms by defaming groups by propagating lies and half truths about practices and beliefs with the objective of socially isolating those groups gangsta rap does all of these things yet legal responses to the publication of songs containing such lyrics as rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome have been timid at best even if we maintain our liberal approach to taboo breaking forms of expression we can still link hip hop to many of the harms that hate speech produces gangsta rap gives the impression that african american and latin american neighbourhoods throughout the usa are violent lawless places even if the pronouncements of rappers such as 50 cent and nwa are overblown or fictitious they enforce social division by vividly discouraging people from entering or interacting with poor minority communities they damage those communities directly by creating a fear of criminality that serves to limit trust and cohesion among individual community members finally violent hip hop is also defamatory it propagates an image of minority communities that emphasises violence poverty and nihilism whilst loudly proclaiming its

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-pro01a,classification not censorship we should expect fans of an art form that is subjected to public criticism and vilification to leap to its defence some of these aficionados whether the medium in question is cinema fine art or pop music make the case for the value of their favourite mode of expression by overstating its positive effects hip hop has long been the focus of controversies surrounding violent music hip hop is closely associated with low level criminality as noted above a number of highly successful hip hop artists have been attacked or killed as a result of feuds within the industry and links between managers promoters and criminal gangs as the academic john mcwhorter has pointed out in numerous 1 publications 2 the positive political and social impact of rap music has been massively overstated as a result of highly charged media coverage of hip hop linked violence as a result attempts to address some of the hips hops most objectionable content lyrics that are misogynist and blankly and uncritically violent have been condemned as unjust assaults on the right to free expression attacks on negative content in hip hop have been made all the more emotive because they appear to be an attempt to restrict the speech of members of vulnerable and marginalised communities side proposition agrees with mcwhorter that listening to music that contains violent themes will not in the absence of other factors cause individuals to behave in a violent way however the content of rap and its strong links with the youngest inhabitants of marginalised stigmatised urban areas mean that it damages the developmental opportunities of teenagers and young people and harms others perceptions of the communities they live in hip hop trades on its authenticity the extent to which it faithfully portrays the lived experience of the inhabitants of deprived inner city areas the greater the veracity of a hip hop track the greater its popularity and cache among fans musicians have gained public recognition as a result of being directly involved in street crime and gang activities 50 cent a high profile gansta artist owes his popularity in part to a shooting in 2000 that left him with 9 bullet wounds 3 this supposed link to reality is the most dangerous aspect of contemporary hip hop culture unlike the simplistic make believe of say action films the experiences related by rappers are also their public personas and become the rationale for their success rap through materialist boasting and sexualised music videos tells vulnerable young men and women from isolated neighbourhoods that their problems can be solved by adopting similarly nihilistic personas the poverty that affects many of the communities that hip hop artists identify with does more than separate individuals from economic opportunity it also confines the inhabitants of these communities geographically politically and culturally it prevents young men and women from becoming aware of perspectives on the world and society that run contrary to the violence of main stream rap with television dominated by the gangsta motif marginalised youngsters are left with little in the way of dissenting voices to convince them that hip hop takes a subjective and commercialised approach to the lives and communities that rappers claim to represent in effect controversial hip hop is capable of sponsoring violent behaviour when it is marketed as an accurate portrayal of relationships values and principles under these circumstances adolescents whose own identity is nascent and malleable can easily be misled into emulating the exploits and attitudes of rappers 4 side proposition advocates the control and classification of controversial forms of music including but not limited to hip hop consistent with principles 1 and 10 classification of this type will follow similar schemes applied to movies and videogames assessments of the content of music will be conducted by a politically independent organisation musicians and record companies will have the ability to appeal the decisions of this body crucially the ban on music containing violent lyrics will take the form of a categorisation scheme content will not be blocked from sale or censored instead as with the sale of pornographic material in many liberal

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con02a,a ban will be ineffective a new legal prohibition on any type of behaviour or conduct can only be set up by investing large amounts of political capital in order to transform vague proposals into a legislative document and then into a fully fledged law this expense can only be justified if the ban is effective if it is seen as a legitimate use of a state s power is enforceable and if it brings about some form of beneficial social change the change being sought in this instance is a reduction in the violence criminality and social disaffection that some people associate with hip hop music and its fans laws do not create changes in behaviour simply because they are laws it is unlikely that the consumers of hip hop will refrain from listening to it the ease with which music can be distributed and performed means that any ban on violent songs will inevitably be ineffective file sharing networks and cross border online stores such as ebay and silk road already enable people to obtain media and controlled goods with little more than a credit card and a forwarding address the total value of all of the music illegally pirated during 2007 is estimated to be 12 5 billion the same network of file sharing systems and data repositories would be used to distribute banned music if proposition s policies became law current urban music genres are already defined and supported by grassroots musicians who specialise in assembling tracks using minimal resources before sharing them among friends or broadcasting them on short range pirate radio stations just as the internet contains a resilient ready made distribution network for music urban communities contain large numbers of ambitious talented amateur artists who will step into fill the void created by large record company s withdrawal from controversial or prohibited genres although a formal ban on the distribution of music has yet to happen within a western liberal democracy similar laws have been created to restrict access to violent videogames following widespread reports of the damaging effects that exposure to violent videogames might have on children australia banned outright the publication of a succession of violent and action oriented titles however in several instances implementation of this ban led only to increased piracy of prohibited games through file

marginalised communities that hip hop emerged from all that anyone requires in order to learn how to rap or to participate in hip hop culture is a pen some paper and possibly a disc of breaks the looped drum and bass lines that are used to time rap verses thanks to its highly social aspect hip hop continues to function as an accessible form of creative expression for members of some of impoverished communities in both the west and elsewhere in the world point 7 suggests that free speech flourishes when we respect believers but are not forced to respect their beliefs free speech debate discusses this principle in the light of religious belief and religious expression however it is also relevant when we consider how our appraisal of an individual s background culture and values affects our willingness to accept or dismiss what she says the positive case for banning or at least condemning hip hop often rests on its ability to reinforce the negative stereotypes of impoverished and marginalised communities that are propagated by majority communities critics of hip hop note that black men have often been stigmatised as violent uncivilised and predatory they claim that many hip hop artists cultivate a purposefully brutal and misogynist persona the popularity of hip hop reflects the acceptance of this stereotype and further entrenches discrimination against young black men this line of thinking portrays hip hop artists as betrayers or exploiters of their communities reinforcing damaging stereotypes and convincing adolescents that a violent rejection of mainstream society is a way to achieve material success arguments of this type fail to recognise the depth of nuance and meaning that words and word play can convey they are predicated on an assumption that the consumers of hip hop engage with it in a simplistic and uncritical way in short such arguments see hip hop fans as being simple minded and easily influenced this perspective neglects the recognition respect the recognition of equality and inherent dignity that is owed to all contributors of a debate moreover it also bars us from properly assessing the appraisal respect owed to the content of hip hop and other controversial musical genres when hip hop is seen as being inherently harmful and as being targeted at an especially impressionable and vulnerable part of society we both demean members of that group and prevent robust discussion of rap lyrics themselves academics such as john mcwhorter see only the advocacy of violence and nihilism in lyrics such as you grow in the ghetto living second rate and your eyes will sing a song of deep hate but these are words that can also be interpreted as astute observation on the brutality that is bred by social exclusion in point of fact there is little in the previous verse or those that follow it you ll admire all the numberbook takers thugs pimps and pushers and the big money makers that could be interpreted as permitting popularising or endorsing violence that is unless the individual reading the verse had already concluded that its intended audience lacked his own critical perspective and understanding of social norms and values even if an observer were ultimately conclude that a particular hip hop track had no redeeming value a broad interpretation of point 7 suggests that he should at the very least credit its artists and listeners with a modicum of intelligence and reflectiveness when we approach music with a custodial mind set determined to protect young listeners from what we see as harm or exploitation we prevent those individuals from access a form of speech that may be the only affordable method of expression open to them just as we allow individuals the right to be heard in a language of their choosing see point 1 we should also accept that perspectives from marginalised communities may not appear in a conventional form under these circumstances it would be

test-free-speech-debate-ldhwbmclg-con01a,violent imagery can serve different purposes calls for a ban on music that references or glorifies violence are frequently based on an overly simplistic understanding of contemporary and popular musical genres it is instructive that the loudest voices of protest raised against violent content in hip hop and rock music are overwhelmingly white middle class middle aged newspaper columnists any ban created under these circumstances would reduce the diversity and depth of popular musical genres by preventing musicians from commenting in any way on violent events banning particular musical tracks due only to the fact that they discuss violent acts would be damaging to the creative industries and would not reflect methods currently used to classify and restrict content appearing in other media criminal acts are punished when an act results in a damaging outcome and because that act is performed with a particular dishonest or malicious intention generally someone cannot be found guilty of murder if they did not intend to kill their victim similarly it is unusual for films or videogames to be censored or banned because they happen to depict violent acts the intention that underlies the use of graphic images or words must also be examined as bbc director general mark thompson noted when discussing the controversial religious

the world violent music does not automatically glorify violence nor does it cause its audience to see violence as something that is glamorous listened to out of context without any attempt to critically analyse the imagery of the song and the intentions of the artists it is easy to condemn many acclaimed examples of popular music as containing violent lyrics by giving into the populist

supreme court has ruled that judea and samaria a k a the west bank areas are held by the state of israel in belligerent occupation 3 therefore israel has no better claim to these lands than that it

to its former lines would be not a prescription for peace but for renewed hostilities johnson advocated new recognized boundaries that would provide security against terror destruction and war 2 an israel that withdrew completely to the 1967 borders would offer a very tempting target since it would be a narrow country with no strategic depth whose main population centres and strategic infrastructure would be within tactical range of forces deployed along the commanding heights of the west bank this would hurt israel s ability to deter future attacks and thus make conflict in the region even more likely this ability of israel to deter aggressors is particularly important not only due to the region s history of aggression against israel but also due to the unpredictable future events in the highly volatile middle east there is no way for example to guarantee that iraq will not evolve into a radical shi ite state that is dependent on iran and hostile to israel indeed king abdullah of jordan has warned of a hostile shi ite axis that could include iran iraq and syria nor that a jordan s palestinian majority might seize power in the state leaving israel to defend itself against a palestinian state that stretches from iraq to kalkilya nor that in the future militant islamic elements will not succeed in gaining control of the egyptian regime 3 given its narrow geographical dimensions a future attack launched from the pre 1967 borders against israel s nine mile wide waist could easily split the country in two especially seeing as islamic militants throughout the middle east are unlikely to be reconciled to israel even by a withdrawal to the 1967 borders such a withdrawal therefore would actually make peace in the region less likely and encourage war

test-international-gmehbisrip1b-con01a,israel has the right to claim minimal territory to ensure security israel has been the victim of multiple major illegal wars of aggression on the part of the arab world most notably in 1948 and 1967 these wars invalidate any special claim made by arabs and palestinians to pre 1967 territory and justify israel in keeping as much territory as is necessary to secure itself against these hostile states israel could have gone much further and taken more territory than it did in 1967 as it was easily winning the war but instead it restricted itself to only taking the territory that was necessary for it to create security buffer 1 when peace deals have allowed israel to improve its security through giving up land historically it has done so for example when it returned the sinai peninsula to egypt in 1982 in exchange for a peace treaty with egypt or when israel returned the small swath of jordanian territory it held when king hussain of jordan wanted to make peace to date israel has withdrawn from approximately 93 percent of the territories it captured in return for peace with syria and an end to palestinian terror it is prepared to withdraw from most of the remaining 7 in dispute although not all israel remains committed to trading land for peace and never annexed the west bank or gaza strip because it expected to return part of these territories in negotiations when the palestinians finally declared that they would recognize israel and renounce terrorism israel agreed to begin to withdraw since 1993 israel has turned over approximately 80 of the gaza strip and more than 40 of the west bank to the palestinian authority thus israel s objection is not so much against returning any of the land captured in 1967 but against returning absolutely all of it and going back completely to the 1967 borders as this would mean giving up territories vital for israel s security the minimal slivers of territory that israel it seeks to maintain through a peace settlement after returning 90 of the pre 1967 territory is very important to its national security as it offers a buffer against future arab wars of aggression this why ehud olmert stressed that only most of the occupied territory could be returned he still argued that some had to be kept for security reasons we can never totally return to the indefensible pre 1967 borders we simply cannot afford to make israel 9 miles wide again at its center we can t allow the palestinians to be a couple miles from tel aviv s ben gurion airport in the age of shoulder fire missiles with the capacity to shoot down jumbo jets 2 moreover israel is in an anomalous situation it is an embattled democracy that historically has had to defend itself repeatedly against the armies of neighbouring arab states whose declared goal was nothing less than israel s eradication the israel defense forces could not afford to miscalculate while other nations like france or kuwait have been overrun occupied and nonetheless have survived to reconstitute themselves israel in contrast cannot depend on obtaining a second chance miscalculation on its part could have had devastating consequences and thus its situation is unique 3 for this critical purpose of national survival therefore the annexed land serves a legally legitimate purpose especially considering that the arab wars

test-international-gpsmhbsosb-pro02a,georgian rule in south ossetia is historically illegitimate and oppressive modern georgia never really controlled s ossetia south ossetia declared independence from georgia shortly after georgia gained independence from the disintegrating ussr in 1991 south ossetia has maintained de facto independence ever since 1 georgia therefore cannot really claim to have had sustained legitimate sovereign control over south ossetia in modern times even the ussr recognised s ossetia as distinct from georgia with the kremlin stating in 1920 that we consider that ossetia should have the power it prefers georgian intrusion into affairs of ossetia would be an unjustified intervention into foreign internal affairs 2 s ossetia was an autonomous region within the ussr it was not considered part of the same region that is now georgia and thus during its years under the ussr s ossetia built up a significant degree of autonomy and independence in its internal functioning therefore georgia s only real claim to south ossetia must extend back nearly a century before the time of the soviet union this significantly weakens georgia s claim over south ossetia but moreover georgia s historical claim on south ossetia is quite weak even in isolation this is because s ossetia has its own distinct language and history to that of georgia ossetian or ossetic is a member of the northeastern iranian branch of indo european languages about 500 000 people speak ossetian in ossetia 3 4 that ossetia has this distinct language is an important fact in favour of its

s nuclear proliferation on nov 19 2010 the anti defamation league released a statement which came from robert g sugarman adl national chair and abraham h foxman adl national director the severe damage that could be inflicted on that relationship by failing to ratify the treaty would inevitably hamper effective american international leadership to stop the iranian nuclear weapons program the iranian nuclear threat is the most serious national security issue facing the united states israel and other allies in the middle east while some senators may have legitimate reservations about the new start treaty or its protocol we believe the interest of our greater and common goal of preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons must take precedence 1 new start is crucial in getting russian support against iran and other rogue nuclear states although the united states needs a strong and reliable nuclear force the chief nuclear danger today comes not from russia but from rogue states such as iran and north korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists given those pressing dangers some question why an arms control treaty with russia matters it matters because it is in both parties interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship it also matters because russia s cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the iranian and north korean programs russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure loose nukes in russia and elsewhere and russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in afghanistan a breeding ground for international terrorism obviously the united states does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends any treaty must be considered on its merits but the new start agreement is clearly in the us national interest and the ramifications of not ratifying it could be significantly negative 2 as us vice president joe biden argued in 2010 new start is also a cornerstone of our efforts to reset relations with russia which have improved significantly in the last two years this has led to real benefits for u s and global security russian cooperation made it possible to secure strong sanctions against iran over its nuclear ambitions and russia canceled a sale to iran of an advanced anti aircraft missile system that would have been dangerously destabilizing russia has permitted the flow of materiel through its territory for our troops in afghanistan and as the nato russia council in lisbon demonstrated european security has been advanced by the pursuit of a more cooperative relationship with russia we should not jeopardize this progress 3 therefore because new start will have significant positive consequences in terms of

the table is a nuclear arms reduction and verification treaty between the united states and russia the treaty called new start would reduce russian and american deployed nuclear weapons to 1 550 and delivery vehicles to 700 each this would be a 33 percent reduction in the existing arsenals which is worth achieving and celebrating even as we know that countless cities and millions of precious human beings could be destroyed by the use of even part of the remaining arsenals still these reductions would be a great step on the way to a safer world as would the re establishment of bilateral intrusive verification measures for both sides also part of the treaty 1 the world is simply a much less secure place without new start and not just because new start means there are physically fewer nuclear weapons and thus a lesser chance of nuclear disasters although this in itself is compelling rather new start also has immense symbolic value in demonstrating that the two greatest powers have enough in common and are interested enough in their mutual security that they can agree to deduce nuclear weapons together it shows that these nations regard each other as partners for world peace not as enemies the alternative world without new start would be one in which the mutual suspicion and animosity of the cold war might continue it is notable that prime minister vladimir putin said in an interview released in early december 2010 that russia might be forced to build up its nuclear forces against the west if the united states fails to ratify the new start treaty 2 the threat of russia or even the us resuming nuclear build ups is a frightening thought for both nations for the world and for peace on top of its other benefits new start is key to opening russian nuclear weapons up for

test-international-glilpdwhsn-pro03a,the new start treaty maintains us nuclear and missile defence the us nuclear armament will be modernized along with new start the obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process the administration has put forth a 10 year plan to spend 84 billion on the energy department s nuclear weapons complex much of the credit for getting the administration to add 14 billion to the originally proposed 70 billion for modernization goes to sen jon kyl the arizona republican who has been vigilant in this effort implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond 1 both us military and civilian leaders insist that the new start treaty will still allow the us to deploy effective missile defenses something which russia was opposed to and so will not affect us missile defense plans the main limit on missile defense is that the treaty prevents the conversion of existing launchers for this purpose this would be more expensive than building new missiles specifically for defense purposes 2 furthermore as joe biden argues new start is important to russian cooperation on missile defense this missile defense system demonstrates america s enduring commitment to article 5 of the washington treaty that an attack on one is an attack on all nato missile defense also provides the opportunity for further improvements in both nato russian and u s russian relations nato and russia agreed at lisbon to carry out a joint ballistic missile threat assessment to resume theater missile defense exercises and to explore further cooperation on territorial missile defense things that were nearly unimaginable two years ago these agreements underscore the strategic importance the alliance attaches to improving its relationship with russia but trust and confidence in our relationship with russia would be undermined without senate approval of the new start treaty which reduces strategic nuclear forces to levels not seen since the 1950s and restores important verification mechanisms that ceased when the first start treaty expired last december 3 in many ways in the 21st century having an abundance of nuclear weapons particularly having too many is more of a liability than an advantage the united states will be far safer with fewer nuclear weapons in the world and a stronger more stable relationship with russia under new start and this is desirable therefore it is clear that new start maintains the important parts of us nuclear capabilities while removing the over abundance which may become a liability due to security and medical concerns and so new start should be supported 1 kissinger henry a shultz george p baker iii

test-international-glilpdwhsn-con02a,the new start treaty helps russia more than the us not only does new start leave in place russia s extant tactical nuclear advantage but it has further loopholes for russian weapons as mitt romney argued in 2010 does the treaty provide gaping loopholes that russia could use to escape nuclear weapon limits entirely yes for example multiple warhead missile bombers are counted under the treaty as only one warhead while we currently have more bombers than the russians they have embarked on new programs for long range bombers and for air launched nuclear cruise missiles thus it is no surprise that russia is happy to undercount missiles on bombers 1 new start also fails to limit rail mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms which russia could potentially make use of the definition of rail mobile icbm launchers was established in the expired start as an erector launcher mechanism for launching icbms and the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted 2 this and associated restrictions and limitations in start are not in the new start this makes it possible for russia to claim that any new rail mobile icbms are not subject to new start limitations 3 mitt romney worries that russia is already working to take advantage of these omissions as drafted it lets russia escape the limit on its number of strategic nuclear warheads loopholes and lapses presumably carefully crafted by moscow provide a path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead reduction targets these omissions would be consistent with russia s plans for a new heavy bomber and reports of growing interest in rail mobile icbms 4 this means that under the treaty limits the united states is the only country that must reduce its launchers and strategic nuclear weapons russia has managed to negotiate the treaty limits so that they simply restrict it to reductions it was already planning to do as a result the united states is making what are effectively unilateral reductions 5 therefore new start is an unequal treaty as it offers more to russia than to the us this is bad for the balance of power and thus bad for world peace and so new start should be opposed 1

test-international-glilpdwhsn-con03a,the new start treaty sets a bad approach for a changing world new start reduces us deterrence in world that is arming not disarming the united states has relied on deterrence for sixty years and as a result has prevented war between the great powers a us drawdown especially as other new powers are arming will undermine deterrence this will then encourage rivals to try to catch the united states while the reductions show that the united states is in decline 1 while proponents of reducing nuclear weapons or reaching global zero argue that possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states is the incentive behind proliferation this is not true the us has consistently taken leadership in the reduction of nuclear arms through treaties but this has so far had no effect in encouraging other nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals and indeed new powers have joined the club reducing nuclear arms through new start will therefore not encourage others to stop pursuing nukes the u s should not be taking steps towards disarmament without all nuclear weapons states including those not signed up to the nuclear non proliferation treaty also being involved 2 new start also fails to speak to the issue of protecting and defending the u s and its allies against strategic attack the treaty fails to recognize that deterrence is no longer simply between the u s and russia and that the whole policy should no longer be based on just against strategic attacks on the united states or very close allies instead it is much more critical to deal with nuclear policy towards rogue states and rising powers 3 finally the us should not set a precedent that it will sacrifice its own interests to bribe russia over issues like iran as the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa argues we are told that the real purpose of new start is to create a stronger u s russia bond in a broader international effort to restrain iran s nuclear weapons program such a justification is wrong iran s nuclear ambitions are no secret neither are russia s past efforts in aiding that program we seriously question whether russia is serious about stopping iran with or without new start there is no reason why the united states should be required to sacrifice its own defense capabilities to inspire russia to a greater degree of diplomatic fortitude if russia is indeed concerned with a nuclear armed iran to its immediate south it should need no extra incentive to take the action necessary to stop it 4 if the u s bribes russia over iran china might expect to get similar treatment over north korea new start puts the us in a disadvantaged position in a changing world and consequently should not be supported 1 brookes peter not a new start but a

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-pro01a,the new start treaty will make for a safer world reducing us and russian nuclear weapons stockpiles makes for a safer world as dr david gushee states the issue on the table is a nuclear arms reduction and verification treaty between the united states and russia the treaty called new start would reduce russian and american deployed nuclear weapons to 1 550 and delivery vehicles to 700 each this would be a 33 percent reduction in the existing arsenals which is worth achieving and celebrating even as we know that countless cities and millions of precious human beings could be destroyed by the use of even part of the remaining arsenals still these reductions would be a great step on the way to a safer world as would the re establishment of bilateral intrusive verification measures for both sides also part of the treaty 1 the world is simply a much less secure place without new start and not just because new start means there are physically fewer nuclear weapons and thus a lesser chance of nuclear disasters although this in itself is compelling rather new start also has immense symbolic value in demonstrating that the two greatest powers have enough in common and are interested enough in their mutual security that they can agree to deduce nuclear weapons together it shows that these nations regard each other as partners for world peace not as enemies the alternative world without new start would be one in which the mutual suspicion and animosity of the cold war might continue it is notable that prime minister vladimir putin said in an interview released in early december 2010 that russia might be forced to build up its nuclear forces against the west if the united states fails to ratify the new start treaty 2 the threat of russia or even the us resuming nuclear build ups is a frightening thought for both nations for the world and for peace on top of its other benefits new start is key to opening russian nuclear weapons up for verification which contributes to trust and peace as former secretaries of state kissinger shultz eagleburger baker and powell argue the agreement emphasizes verification providing a valuable window into russia s nuclear arsenal since the original start expired last december russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes in its strategic nuclear arsenal and the united states has been unable to conduct on site inspections each day america s understanding of russia s arsenal has been degraded and resources have been diverted from national security tasks to try to fill the

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-pro03a,the new start treaty maintains us nuclear and missile defence the us nuclear armament will be modernized along with new start the obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process the administration has put forth a 10 year plan to spend 84 billion on the energy department s nuclear weapons complex much of the credit for getting the administration to add 14 billion to the originally proposed 70 billion for modernization goes to sen jon kyl the arizona republican who has been vigilant in this effort implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond 1 both us military and civilian leaders insist that the new start treaty will still allow the us to deploy effective missile defenses something which russia was opposed to and so will not affect us missile defense plans the main limit on missile defense is that the treaty prevents the conversion of existing launchers for this purpose this would be more expensive than building new missiles specifically for defense purposes 2 furthermore as joe biden argues new start is important to russian cooperation on missile defense this missile defense system demonstrates america s enduring commitment to article 5 of the washington treaty that an attack on one is an attack on all nato missile defense also provides the opportunity for further improvements in both nato russian and u s russian relations nato and russia agreed at lisbon to carry out a joint ballistic missile threat assessment to resume theater missile defense exercises and to explore further cooperation on territorial missile defense things that were nearly unimaginable two years ago these agreements underscore the strategic importance the alliance attaches to improving its relationship with russia but trust and confidence in our relationship with russia would be undermined without senate approval of the new start treaty which reduces strategic nuclear forces to levels not seen since the 1950s and restores important verification mechanisms that ceased when the first start treaty expired last december 3 in many ways in the 21st century having an abundance of nuclear weapons particularly having too many is more of a liability than an advantage the united states will be far safer with fewer nuclear weapons in the world and a stronger more stable relationship with russia under new start and this is desirable therefore it is clear that new start maintains the important parts of us nuclear capabilities while removing the over abundance which may become a liability due to security and medical concerns and so new start should be supported 1 kissinger henry a shultz george p baker iii

test-politics-oglilpdwhsn-con02a,the new start treaty helps russia more than the us not only does new start leave in place russia s extant tactical nuclear advantage but it has further loopholes for russian weapons as mitt romney argued in 2010 does the treaty provide gaping loopholes that russia could use to escape nuclear weapon limits entirely yes for example multiple warhead missile bombers are counted under the treaty as only one warhead while we currently have more bombers than the russians they have embarked on new programs for long range bombers and for air launched nuclear cruise missiles thus it is no surprise that russia is happy to undercount missiles on bombers 1 new start also fails to limit rail mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms which russia could potentially make use of the definition of rail mobile icbm launchers was established in the expired start as an erector launcher mechanism for launching icbms and the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted 2 this and associated restrictions and limitations in start are not in the new start this makes it possible for russia to claim that any new rail mobile icbms are not subject to new start limitations 3 mitt romney worries that russia is already working to take advantage of these omissions as drafted it lets russia escape the limit on its number of strategic nuclear warheads loopholes and lapses presumably carefully crafted by moscow provide a path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead reduction targets these omissions would be consistent with russia s plans for a new heavy bomber and reports of growing interest in rail mobile icbms 4 this means that under the treaty limits the united states is the only country that must reduce its launchers and strategic nuclear weapons russia has managed to negotiate the treaty limits so that they simply restrict it to reductions it was already planning to do as a result the united states is making what are effectively unilateral reductions 5 therefore new start is an unequal treaty as it offers more to russia than to the us this is bad for the balance of power and thus bad for world peace and so new start should be opposed 1

to try to catch the united states while the reductions show that the united states is in decline 1 while proponents of reducing nuclear weapons or reaching global zero argue that possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states is the incentive behind proliferation this is not true the us has consistently taken leadership in the reduction of nuclear arms through treaties but this has so far had no effect in encouraging other nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals and indeed new powers have joined the club reducing nuclear arms through new start will therefore not encourage others to stop pursuing nukes the u s should not be taking steps towards disarmament without all nuclear weapons states including those not signed up to the nuclear non proliferation treaty also being involved 2 new start also fails to speak to the issue of protecting and defending the u s and its allies against strategic attack the treaty fails to recognize that deterrence is no longer simply between the u s and russia and that the whole policy should no longer be based on just against strategic attacks on the united states or very close allies instead it is much more critical to deal with nuclear policy towards rogue states and rising powers 3 finally the us should not set a precedent that it will sacrifice its own interests to bribe russia over issues like iran as the jewish institute for

program such a justification is wrong iran s nuclear ambitions are no secret neither are russia s past efforts in aiding that program we seriously question whether russia is serious about stopping iran with or without new start there is no reason why the united states should be required to sacrifice its own defense capabilities to inspire russia to a greater degree of diplomatic fortitude if russia is indeed concerned with a nuclear armed iran to its immediate south it should need no extra incentive to take the action necessary to stop it 4 if the u s bribes russia over iran china might

restrain the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons missile defense systems and missile delivery systems 1 the atrophying u s nuclear arsenal and weapons enterprise make reductions in the u s strategic nuclear arsenal even more dangerous the new start treaty allows nuclear modernization but while the us capacity to modernize nuclear weapons is limited and either congress or the president is likely to prevent modernization on cost grounds the russians have a large if unknown advantage over the united states in terms of nonstrategic particularly tactical and nuclear weapons the new start treaty however ignores these weapons entirely as it is focused on strategic arms this therefore leaves the russians with an advantage and potentially reduces the potential for deterrence in areas beyond the us 2 new start also restricts us missile defence options the obama administration insists the treaty doesn t affect it but the kremlin s takes a different view start can operate and be viable only if the united states of america refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively 3 new start imposes restrictions on u s missile defence options in at least four areas first the preamble recognizes the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms it seeks to make sure defensive arms do not undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the parties so defensive arms must be reduced to allow offensive arms to remain effective 4 russia also issued a unilateral statement on

test-culture-tlhrilsfhwr-pro02a,the failure of rule of law as the anthropologist and lawyer sally falk moore observed law is only ever a piecemeal intervention by the state in the life of society i laws are ultimately social norms that are taught enforced and arbitrated on by the state the value of these norms is such that they are deemed to be a vital part of a society s identity and the state is entrusted with their protection however this ideal can be difficult to achieve debate as to which norms the state should be custodian of is constant where there is a disconnect between a law and the daily lives aspirations and struggles of a society it becomes unlikely that that law will be complied with generally a state will not be able to give a pronouncement the force of law if it does not reflect the values held by a majority of a society compliance with the law can be even harder to obtain in highly plural societies even in plural societies ruled peacefully by an effective central government such as india communities conceptions of children s rights may be radically different from those set down in law the indian child marriage restraint act has been in force since 1929 but the practice remains endemic in southern india to this day ii governments can attempt to enforce compliance with a law through education incentives or deterrence what if the state that is intended to mount the piecemeal intervention of banning the use of child soldiers is weak corrupt or non existent what if a state cannot carry out structured interventions of the type described above norms that state that the conscription of children is acceptable due to tradition or need will be dominant situations of this type will be the rule rather than the exception in underdeveloped states and states where conflict is so rife that children have become participants in warfare the icc has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals with command over military units who use children as combatants iii but how should the concept of a commander be defined in these circumstances in order for the juristic principles underlying the authority of the icc to function properly it is necessary for there to be a degree of certainty and accessibility underlying laws promulgated by a state while ignorance of the law is not a defence before the icc it impossible to call a system of law fair or just that is not

that there will be a clear division between aggressors and defenders that armies will be organised according to chains of command the civilians will not be targeted and will be evacuated from conflict

only as a defence to the use of child soldiers it will still be open for icc prosecutors to prove that the use of child soldiers has been systematic pernicious and deliberate rather than the product of uncertainty necessity and unstable legal norms moreover not all defences are complete defences they do not all result in acquittal and are often used by judges to mitigate the harshness of certain sentences it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances at the very least those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy due to the nature of conflicts in developing nations where the geographic influence of recognised governments is limited and multiple local law making bodies may contribute to an armed struggle it is difficult for the international community to directly oversee combat itself united nations troops are often underfunded unmotivated and poorly trained being sourced primarily from the same continent as the belligerent parties in a conflict when peacekeepers are deployed from western nations their rules of engagement have previously prevented robust protection of civilian populations ironically this is partly the result of concerns that western states might be accused of indulging in neo colonialism it is outrageous for the international community to dictate standards of war time conduct to communities and states unable to enforce them while withholding the assistance and expertise that might allow them to do so therefore the icc as a specialist legal and investigative body should be encouraged to use the expertise it has accumulated to distinguish between child military participation driven by a desire to terrorise populations or quickly reinforce

is entrusted with their protection however this ideal can be difficult to achieve debate as to which norms the state should be custodian of is constant where there is a disconnect between a law and the daily lives aspirations and struggles of a society it becomes unlikely that that law will be complied with generally a state will not be able to give a pronouncement the force of law if it does not reflect the values held by a majority of a society compliance with the law can be even harder to obtain in highly plural societies even in plural societies ruled peacefully by an effective central government such as india communities conceptions of children s rights may be radically different from those set down in law the indian child marriage restraint act has been in force since 1929 but the practice remains endemic in southern india to this day ii governments can attempt to enforce compliance with a law through education incentives or deterrence what if the state that is intended to mount the piecemeal intervention of banning the use of child soldiers is weak corrupt or non existent what if a state cannot carry out structured interventions of the type described above norms that state that the conscription of children is acceptable due to tradition or need will be dominant situations of this type will be the rule rather than the exception in underdeveloped states and states

test-society-tlhrilsfhwr-pro04a,the cultural construction of armed conflict the jurisdiction of the icc is primarily exercised according to culturally constructed assumptions about the way war works that there will be a clear division between aggressors and defenders that armies will be organised according to chains of command the civilians will not be targeted and will be evacuated from conflict zones but countless conflicts in africa and central asia have proven these assumptions to be flawed it should not be forgotten that almost all formulations of this motion define cultural relativism only as a defence to the use of child soldiers it will still be open for icc prosecutors to prove that the use of child soldiers has been systematic pernicious and deliberate rather than the product of uncertainty necessity and unstable legal norms moreover not all defences are complete defences they do not all result in acquittal and are often used by judges to mitigate the harshness of certain sentences it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances at the very least those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy due to the nature of conflicts in developing nations where the geographic influence of recognised governments is limited and multiple local law making bodies may contribute to an armed struggle it is difficult for the international community to directly oversee combat itself united nations troops are often underfunded unmotivated and poorly trained being sourced primarily from the same continent as the belligerent parties in a conflict when peacekeepers are deployed from western nations their rules of engagement have previously prevented robust protection of civilian populations ironically this is partly the result of concerns that western states might be accused of indulging in neo colonialism it is outrageous for the international community to dictate standards of war time conduct to communities and states unable to enforce them while withholding the assistance and expertise that might allow them to do so therefore the icc as a specialist legal and investigative body should be encouraged to use the expertise it has accumulated to distinguish between child military participation driven by a desire to terrorise populations or quickly reinforce
